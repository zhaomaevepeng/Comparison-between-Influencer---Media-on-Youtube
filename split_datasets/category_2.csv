The Economist,2.0,R8VBRCs2jTU,"When central banks raise interest rates, it’s big news The bank is judging... ...that the only way they can try to pull down inflation... ...is to carry on raising interest rates We’re going to see rising rates Rising interest rates that will make the cost of borrowing go up It can send ripples across the whole economy It can sink consumer confidence... ...result in fewer jobs and lower wages, and cause stock prices to fall If they go too far too fast, it can tip economies into recession So why do central banks raise interest rates? Let’s start with the basics If you borrow money, you’ll have to pay back a little extra... ...to make it worthwhile for the lender Well, I think we can make you this loan, you have a good reputation... ...we know you’re reliable I’m glad you think so This is the interest rate So if you are taking out a loan... ...you want the interest rate to be as low as possible... ...so you don’t have to pay that much back On the flip side, if you want to save money... ...then a high interest rate means you can earn more on your savings See it as a reward for leaving money in your account But the size of your reward depends on the circumstances There’s no single interest rate in the economy You’ve got thousands of banks setting their own commercial rates That’s all influenced, though, by the interest rate that the central bank sets A central bank is like a bank for banks Just like you and your savings account... ...banks also earn interest when they leave money with the central bank Commercial banks have these things called reserves So that’s a bit like their cash on hand Commercial banks lend those excess reserves to each other at an interest rate... ...and they also can deposit their excess reserves at the central bank And when they do that, they can earn an interest rate Ordinary people can’t access the interest rate on the excess reserves... ...but it still affects them And that’s the idea When central banks raise interest rates... ...they’re trying to control inflation—how fast prices rise for everyone They were £1.29, now they’re £1.39, and that’s in the space of four weeks Central banks like the Fed or the Bank of England or the European Central Bank... ...are all trying to hit an inflation target of 2% Interest rates are a really powerful tool that they have to do that If inflation is seen as too high, that’s when banks raise interest rates The change spreads through the financial system and slows down the rate of inflation Here’s how A rise in interest rates from a central bank... ...means that a commercial bank will earn more on their reserves They might make more from keeping their money in a central bank than lending it out So if they do lend it out, they’ll raise their interest rates... ...to make it worth their while How that affects consumers depends on the economy Take mortgages In places like Finland or Australia... ...lots of people have mortgages with variable interest rates If you’ve got a variable-rate mortgage, where the interest rate that you pay... ...is linked to the central bank’s interest rate... ...then higher interest rates mean that, essentially, immediately... ...the higher rate will translate into less cash to spend on other things Less spare cash means households will spend less And less spending means businesses will be warier of raising prices This should lower inflation In other countries, like America or Canada... ...a bigger share of mortgages are set at fixed rates People with fixed rates are protected... ...against the direct effects of an interest rate rise... ...but will still feel an indirect impact Higher interest rates mean that mortgages will become more expensive If that is affecting all new buyers, then house prices will begin to fall And that will make everyone who owns a home feel poorer... ...and therefore they might spend less Lower spending will translate into lower inflation And it’s not just consumers who will tighten the purse strings When interest rates rise... ...then businesses will find it more expensive to borrow and invest That generally means less economic activity It might mean fewer jobs are created Fewer jobs and lower wages could mean less money for households... ...and consumer confidence might suffer Which also means less spending People are grappling with a decline in real wages... ...meaning their money buys less When interest rates rise, that will tend to slow down spending, investment... ...and generally depress economic activity Overall that will make businesses more reluctant to raise their prices... ...and that will tend to pull back inflation It sounds straightforward, right? But the trick is judging how far to go In 1981, the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank... ...allowed interest rates to rise to a whopping 19% The move curbed inflation, but it led to widespread economic pain I regret to say that we’re in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression It is very difficult to get inflation under control... ...without severely denting economic activity In America, it’s been over 70 years since they’ve managed to get inflation down... ...from over 5% without causing a recession A little inflation is OK It keeps the economy moving at a sensible speed But inflation staying high for too long is a problem Higher prices means employees will need higher wages... ...pushing up costs for businesses That could drive up prices further... ...potentially leading to an upward spiral of wages and prices Retail inflation in India has surged to 7.8% The combination of tepid economic activity and high inflation... ...poses serious challenges for the Indian economy going forward Central bankers are really concerned about setting expectations of inflation The idea is that, if it can show that it is credible... ...that it will always act to get inflation back down to 2%... ...then maybe it won’t have to raise interest rates... ...and then lower them in this kind of seesaw fashion Raising interest rates can slow an economy right down The trouble is, the brake pedal has a delay It can take as long as two years... ...to see the full results from interest rate changes Central banks know this So when they set interest rates... ...they’re actually trying to read the road ahead But predicting the future isn’t easy The problem is it’s difficult for the central bank to work out... ...whether the inflation will fall back on its own And even when central banks do get it right... ...they might still cause a crash It may be a blunt instrument, but raising interest rates... ...is still central banks’ main tool for taming inflation Central bankers would say that, yes, raising interest rates can be painful Slowing down the economy is not fun But it’s worth it It’s worth it to get low and steady inflation... ...so that in the long run, you don’t have to think about it Thank you for watching To read more of our coverage on interest rates, click the link And don’t forget to subscribe when central banks raise interest rates it's big news bank is judging that the only way they can try to pull down inflation is to carry on raising interest rates we're going to see rising rates rising interest rates that will make the cost to borrowing go up it can send ripples across the whole economy it can sink consumer confidence result in fewer jobs and lower wages and cause stock prices to fall if they go too far too fast it can tip economies into recession so why do central banks raise interest rates [Music] let's start with the basics if you borrow money you'll have to pay back a little extra to make it worthwhile for the lender well i think we can make you this long you have a good reputation we know you're reliable i'm glad you think so this is the interest rate so if you are taking out a loan you want the interest rate to be as low as possible so you don't have to pay that much back on the flip side if you want to save money then a high interest rate means you can earn more on your savings see it as a reward for leaving money in your account but the size of your reward depends on the circumstances there's no single interest rate in the economy you've got thousands of banks setting their own commercial rates that's all influenced though by the interest rate that the central bank sets a central bank is like a bank for banks just like you and your savings account banks also earn interest when they leave money with a central bank commercial banks have these things called reserves so that's a bit like their cash on hand commercial banks lend those excess reserves to each other at an interest rate and they also can deposit their excess reserves at the central bank and when they do that they can earn an interest rate ordinary people can't access the interest rate on the excess reserves but it still affects them and that's the idea when central banks raise interest rates they're trying to control inflation how fast prices rise for everyone they were 129 now they won 39 and last in the space of four weeks central banks like the fed or the bank of england or the european central bank are all trying to hit an inflation target of two percent interest rates are a really powerful tool that they have to do that if inflation is seen as too high that's when banks raise interest rates the change spreads through the financial system and slows down the rate of inflation here's how a rise in interest rates from a central bank means that a commercial bank will earn more on their reserves they might make more from keeping their money in a central bank then lending it out so if they do lend it out they'll raise their interest rates to make it worth their while how that affects consumers depends on the economy take mortgages in places like finland or australia lots of people have mortgages with variable interest rates if you've got a variable rate mortgage where the interest rate that you pay is linked to the central bank's interest rate then higher interest rates mean that essentially immediately the higher rate will translate into less cash to spend on other things less spare cash means households will spend less and less spending means businesses will be warier of raising prices this should lower inflation in other countries like america or canada a bigger share of mortgages are set at fixed rates people with fixed rates are protected against the direct effects of an interest rate rise but will still feel an indirect impact higher interest rates mean that mortgages will become more expensive if that is affecting all new buyers then house prices will begin to fall and that will make everyone who owns a home feel poorer and therefore they might spend less lower spending will translate into lower inflation and it's not just consumers who will tighten the purse strings when interest rates rise then businesses will find it more expensive to borrow and invest that generally means less economic activity it might mean fewer jobs are created fewer jobs and lower wages could mean less money for households and consumer confidence might suffer which also means less spending people are grappling with a decline in real wages meaning their money buys less when interest rates rise that will tend to slow down spending investment and generally depress economic activity overall that will make businesses more reluctant to raise their prices and that will tend to pull back inflation it sounds straightforward right but the trick is judging how far to go in 1981 the federal reserve america's central bank allowed interest rates to rise to a whopping 19 the move curbed inflation but it

The Wall Street Journal,2.0,oRdLvp6H3CU,"- [Narrator] Plane tickets, gasoline, groceries. Inflation has hit the US hard. In 2022, the consumer price index rose at its fastest pace in more than four decades. - So the CPI, as it's more commonly known, is pretty much the most closely watched indicator of inflation in the US, and consequently, the world. - [Narrator] The consumer price index estimates the change in prices for a basket of goods and services that represents the average household spending. Calculations made from that basket are used to make decisions that affect Americans all over the country. Decisions about adjusting tax brackets and benefits like Social Security and food stamps. And it's one of the indexes watched by officials at the Federal Reserve. - Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting and it will continue to do so. - [Narrator] But how is this basket selected and used to calculate the CPI? And when shaping policy decisions, why does the Fed pay the most attention to a different index? (playful music) The department in charge of the index, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, looks at several categories, each given a different importance to compute the month's percent change. Some of the most important categories are food, transportation and housing. - When you pull that all together, housing is a big, I mean, it's the biggest expense that we pay for out of pocket. Rent, your mortgage, that's gonna be a hefty chunk more than anything else. - [Narrator] The BLS gives each category its relative importance based on a survey of what consumers buy. Keeping track of all of those items people spend money on and their prices changes month to month is the job of BLS's price checkers. The agency employs over 450 workers who track prices for up to 100,000 goods and services and 8,000 housing units every month based on the survey of what consumers are purchasing. To make sure products they are price tracking haven't changed, they compare the product to a list of data points from the month before. Sometimes that list can be up to 11 pages. This process helps to ensure the CPI's accuracy. The BLS is basing those calculations off of an urban consumer paying out of pocket. The formula excludes non-direct spending, like payments from nonprofit organizations that provide services to households, Medicare and Medicaid, and employer-sponsored healthcare plans. But again, this is just an average. (till beeping) Inflation affects different people differently. - How you feel inflation depends a lot on what's in your spending basket, and how that differs from the average person's as captured in the CPI. If you have to drive to work every day, you are feeling inflation a lot more than the person who has to take the Subway because the gas prices have gone up so much. - [Narrator] And the index doesn't include everything. That's why some, like the Federal Reserve, prefer indexes they see as broader, like the Personal-Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE. - Over the 12 months, in April, total PCE prices, that's Personal-Consumption Expenditures Prices rose 6.3%. - [Narrator] One of the reasons the Fed prefers this index is that the CPI only transitions items in and out of the basket every two years, while the PCE changes its basket month to month based on consumer trends. The variations in how CPI and PCE are calculated mean that the two indexes can reflect American inflation slightly differently but the Fed takes both into account. - The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. - [Narrator] Looking at multiple indexes gives the Fed a broad picture of American inflation. - CPI's undoubtedly something that they're watching closely, especially the month-on-month movement, like that's an important gauge of it does this, inflation we're seeing, does it have momentum? - [Narrator] And rising inflation of vital items, especially over long periods of time can cause more issues, like inflation becoming embedded in the economy. - We at the Fed understand the hardships that high inflation is causing. We're strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we're moving expeditiously to do so. - [Narrator] When inflation remains high for too long, consumers begin to change their behavior in ways that can keep prices elevated. - So for instance, like oh, my bills are getting really expensive, so I'm gonna ask for a raise and then your boss is like people seem to be willing to pay my higher prices, so I'll just give this person a raise and raise my prices. That keeps inflation kind of chugging along in a way that can be eventually harmful for the economy. - [Narrator] By looking at changes to individual categories, like housing and food, consumers can learn specific information from the overall CPI. - That's gonna give you a sense of whether inflation is broadening, and that's really the concern right now for the economy. - [Narrator] The CPI is a useful tool for economists and consumers alike. And it's a good indicator of whether inflation will begin to subside or whether it will become more embedded in the economy. (dramatic music) (items beeping)"
CNN 10,2.0,Khou5Qz4A4E,inflation is the textbook term for prices rising over time and purchasing power falling think of a trip to the grocery store it sets you back 100 a year from now you buy all the same items but they now cost a hundred and three dollars that's inflation three percent to be exact so what causes inflation a rise in production costs is one scenario for example booming energy prices can drive up the cost of transportation or manufacturing rising wages can also contribute to inflation if business owners have to pay workers more they might also raise prices to cover those higher labor costs inflation can also happen when the demand for goods exceeds supply then businesses selling those items can increase prices prices going up slowly is generally considered a good thing especially if wages rise too it helps keep the economy dynamic and growing the u.s central bank has even a target inflation rate 2 percent but inflation can quickly get out of control when governments print too much money to pay for spending when not enough real value underlies that paper prices surge that's called hyperinflation it happened in germany in zimbabwe in the 2000s and most recently in venezuela and it's the fed's job to make sure the united states keeps the inflation rate on track
More Perfect Union,2.0,XzY_SHNxWXQ,"Do you feel like the prices of normal things you buy every day are going up? Well, supposedly we can thank... ...rising inflation. The main thing is inflation. The American people are facing the highest inflation in more than ten years. Chicken, eggs, meat A pound of steak is up by two bucks. A pound of bacon costs over seven dollars. Seven dollar bacon. So what happened? The official inflation story in the media goes like this: Workers are demanding too much money. Costs of raw materials and transportation are going up, and the Biden administration has pumped too much money into the economy. But that's not the full picture. There's something that corporate America doesn't want you to know. We searched through SEC filings, monitored corporate earnings calls and looked through corporate financial reports, and we found some startling evidence of what's really behind inflation. This is The Class Room from More Perfect Union. Here's a clip from one of the people who has control over prices: John Catsimatidis, president of Gristedes and D'Agostino supermarkets. He's also a real estate and oil CEO. You know how CEOs are on Wall Street, they go, they live quarter by quarter. If they're off by a penny in earnings, Wall Street is not forgiving. So what are the CEOs doing? They're raising prices! I've seen food prices going up. Promotions are down to zero. Why give away something when you don't have to give it away and you make more margin? That's a confession. Why give away something when you don't have to give it away and you make more margin? Business leaders are admitting that corporations are using the narrative of hyperinflation as an excuse to raise prices on you and increase profits for themselves. Let's look at some corporate earnings calls. That's where companies tell investors how much money the company is making and their plans to make more. A study by Bank of America found that these reports mentioned inflation 1100% more in the second quarter of 2021 than in the previous year. But while they blame inflation for rising prices, the largest corporations in America have never made more money. The Wall Street Journal reported that two out of three of the biggest U.S. publicly traded companies had larger profit margins this year than they did prior to the pandemic in 2019. Nearly 100 of these massive corporations reported profits in 2021 that are 50% above profit margins in 2019. This is a clip from the 2021 third quarter earnings of Tyson. The meat processor whose chicken you might have in your freezer. Some quick business talk translation: when he says “pricing improved,” he means Tyson was happy to raise prices, and that was good news for Tyson shareholders. Tyson wants people like you and me to believe that they were forced to raise prices as a result of inflation. But the company is making almost double what it made the year before Inflation gave them the excuse they needed to raise prices and reap record profits. Here's legendary investor Warren Buffett explaining that businesses are finding they can simply raise prices without it hurting their sales. It's very interesting. I mean, we're raising prices. People are raising prices to us and it's being accepted. Here's Kellogg's CEO Steve Cahillane, who made $11.6 million last year. If you look backwards and you see what we've done, you know we've been successful at driving pricing. The good news is elasticities have performed very well, so they've been lower than historically. That's how much a company can change a price and get away with it. People will still buy it. In the same call, Kellogg's announced Kellogg's isn't alone. Mondelez, the giant multinational food corporation that makes everything from Oreos, Double Stuf and not, to Halls Cough Drops, to Philadelphia Cream Cheese plans to raise prices by 7% in 2022, despite a record $1.08 billion in profits in the second quarter of 2021. That's double the profits of the year before. Corporations are seizing the opportunity to engage in massive profiteering, because they can. They want to report higher profits to their investors so their stock prices go higher. They don't care you have to pay more for your groceries. So as big companies raise prices, what are our politicians, corporate media and CEOs blaming it on? Common sense social spending programs, and labor rights. Or anything that could strengthen our nation's working class. You pay people to stay home, you inflex more money into the economy from government, which only drives up inflation. Yeah, that's the most powerful Republican in the House saying the reason we can't give people unemployment is because they'll put that money back into the economy. Some other conservatives were super close to getting it. Every month since Joe Biden took the oath of office, prices have risen faster than wages. The question is, are your wages rising as fast as your costs? Probably not. But Carlson and Barrasso don't call for higher wages. They immediately pivot to ripping on social spending programs like McCarthy. People are feeling the pain and the bite taken out of their wallet. Even without the specific yet raised taxes that the Democrats are proposing. The American people have already taken a pay cut. No government in the history of the world has ever spent more money than Joe Biden is spending right now. Corporations are just going to pass it on to the consumer. This strategy – hiding price increases and massive margins behind an economic term – isn't new. Politicians, corporate media and ultra rich CEOs used to use the deficit as a scare tactic to prevent government spending. But now it's big, bad inflation they're hyping to convince people we can't afford programs most Americans want, like universal pre-K, infrastructure investments, guaranteed paid time-off, food assistance and paid family leave. Inflation is real, but it's important to note who to blame. It's not social spending programs or workers demanding higher wages. It's large corporations through the politicians they control in Washington, D.C., and the pundits they fund on television, trying their hardest to keep their profits at whatever cost. do you feel like the prices of normal things you buy every day are going up well supposedly we can think Rising inflation the main thing is inflation the American people are facing the highest inflation in more than 10 years chicken eggs meat a pound of steak is up by two bucks pound of bacon cost over $7 $7 bacon $7 bacon so what happened the official inflation story in the media goes like this workers are

Guardian Australia,2.0,XuQVNmU7FcY,contrary to what you might think lettuce didn't become expensive just because it was sick of being pushed to the side of your plate and finally decided to demand what it knows it's worth actually it's far more complicated and it's all got to do with something called inflation inflation inflation inflation inflation but um what is that [Music] so inflation can be a bit confusing because when people say inflation they might be talking about one of two things they might be talking about things getting more expensive the lettuce costing 13 now the cost of living just generally going up or they might be talking about money being worth less and less like how your grandma always goes on about how she used to be able to go to the movies with two dollars in her pocket and come home and still have change uh or in more extreme out of control scenarios people being forced to use wheelbarrows full of cash just to buy a loaf of bread the thing is prices going up and the purchasing power of money going down are the same thing and they're both inflation and it's a shame that inflation can be so hard to understand because while it can be useful in small amounts it can also be extremely disruptive and it's everyday folks who tend to cop it the worse a comfortable weekly supermarket shop might double while someone's paycheck stays the same or someone's life savings might go from being a modest home deposit to hardly filling up their car it can push people into poverty and stop them from accessing the things they need like medicine food and housing but in order to understand inflation you'll first need to understand supply and demand you've heard of that right like when lots of people want to buy something but then there's not much of it around so then businesses can get away with charging a lot more for it so consider a situation where people suddenly have a lot more money to spend oh say the government has given out stimulus payments in order to avoid a recession or maybe a small nation discovers there's actually a ton of natural resources under their feet people will suddenly have a lot more cash to splash and they'll want to splash it so suddenly there's more demand and prices can and often do go up sometimes central banks can actually fuel inflation like if they were to lower the cash rate making borrowing money cheaper easier access to money encourages people to spend and invest and well you've created more demand without actually creating more goods and services so prices go up inflation can also happen when there's less supply uh say a war breaks out and it's become geopolitically unpopular to trade with certain large exporters well there'll suddenly be less competition in the market and the politically favorable exporters can charge more for their goods and services because to be honest who else are you going to go to in some cases sudden shocks can also hit supply levels like say you're a farmer and a um climate change fueled flood wipes out half your asparagus crops well then you're still going to need to pay all your stuff you need to pay for the repairs you need to just stay afloat so you might just have to charge double at the next farmer's market per stalk and when things like this happen and the cost of living goes up it's only natural that workers might increase pressure on employers to raise wages either by unionizing or just leaving for a better paying job if there's one available okay people have more money brilliant uh that does possibly mean that businesses could get away with raising prices again though which i guess would increase the cost of living which then could lead to increased pressure for higher wages which then could then lead to higher prices which then oh the dollar doesn't buy as much as it used to does it it's worth noting though that at least in australia for the past few decades uh demands from workers like this really have not been a driving force behind our inflation cycle in fact our wages are barely going up in some cases inflation is also just caused by bad fiscal policy like it might be tempting for a government to try and fix a cash flow problem by just printing more money but if you create more money demand without also creating more goods and services supply well then the balance can get thrown out of whack and money loses value we know this is true because it was actually one of the key causes of a hyper-inflation crisis in zimbabwe in the late noughties where the country was forced to put a 100 trillion dollar note into circulation as inflation just got further and further out of control inflation can also become a problem when there just isn't enough competition between businesses providing the same goods like if you had to switch phone plans but only had a few choices of which telco to go with well then those businesses would be in a much better position to widen their profit margins charge you more than if they had to compete against hundreds of different providers all that being said some inflation is normal and even desirable sometimes like say you had a large debt a mortgage well then mild inflation will make it easier to pay that off because the price you originally paid for the house will stay the same while your wages will notionally increase also the value of your house will go up too so you'll be pretty confident that you'll be able to sell it at a profit in an ideal world where the balance is just right this could create jobs it could mean more income taxes which would mean more money for schools and hospitals and you get the picture but of course often the balance isn't exactly right and the results are less rosy
The Economist,2.0,_qItQZEJQxQ,what causes inflation inflation is the rate at which prices increase across the economy it helps explain why an American big Maps cost less than three US Dollars 20 years ago but is around five dollars today on the traditional explanation is too much money chasing too few goods if a central bank prints too much money or makes it slow then prices will rise events like Wars would cause a shortage of goods can also increase prices so a little bit of inflation doesn't really hurt anybody but when inflation is high and volatile and when it's unexpected it can do a lot of damage to the way a capitalist system runs borrowing and lending money becomes very difficult businesses struggle to keep up with Rising costs and they may be forced to employ fewer people to avoid extremes of inflation most central banks try and keeping it around two percent to stop prices from rising they can increase interest rates but how exactly does that work like the part two
Barron's,2.0,4HmnJ5qstc8,we remain committed to Bringing inflation back down to our two percent goal so here's how that's actually being done the Federal Reserve or fed is the country's Central Bank it regulates financial markets and controls interest rates which can be used to fight inflation the lower the rates the cheaper it is to borrow money which can stimulate economic activity but may lead to high demand and Rising prices during periods of high inflation the Central Bank increases interest rates making borrowing money more expensive this is supposed to lead to reduced spending which can help ease inflation but this also has some side effects expensive borrowing puts a strain on the economy and can lead to a rise in unemployment the fed's job requires a balancing act trying to keep prices stable while maximizing employment low rates can inadvertently spur inflation and an over correction to curb that inflation could cause a recession
The Wall Street Journal,2.0,AkMsMDk_brU,"- [Narrator] With inflation hovering around its highest rate in 40 years, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates several times in 2022. This is Fed chairman Jerome Powell on what will be needed to ensure a long economic expansion. - That's gonna require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2% goal. - [Narrator] The way the central bank does this is by changing the federal funds rate, its main tool for managing the economy. You can see on this chart that the rate was lowered to nearly 0% in 2020 to boost the economy at the beginning of the pandemic. - There is an important job for us to move away from these very highly simulative monetary policy settings. - [Narrator] Adjustments to the federal funds rate influence a range of borrowing costs, from how much you own your credit card to mortgage rates. They also shape broader decisions made by companies, like how many people to hire or whether to raise prices. Here's how the federal funds rate works and how just one rate can guide the entire economy. - The Fed meets every six or so weeks, and they're looking at a range of economic data at those meetings, but they have two main goals. One is to ensure stable prices and low inflation. And the other is to make sure that the layer market is strong. - [Narrator] Nick Timiraos covers how the fed guides the economy through crises. He says, you can think of the economy as a car and the fed as the driver. - They wanna make sure that the economy's not growing too slow. And when it is, they'll push on the gas but they also wanna make sure that it's not going too fast. And so they'll slow the economy down by pressing on the break. - [Narrator] This is where the federal funds rate comes in. - When you hear on the news about the fed raising interest rates or cutting interest rates, what they're actually deciding to do is to raise or to lower the federal funds rate. - [Narrator] This is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow money overnight, but there's a catch. The federal funds rate isn't directly set by the federal reserve. So in order to influence it, the fed uses a couple of other tools to set a target range. These tools are rates that the fed controls in its role as a bank for banks. Here's the target range that was in place during 2021. The federal reserve sets an upper limit and a lower limit with the goal of keeping the effective federal funds rate somewhere in between. The upper limit is determined by interest on reserve balances. This is the rate of interest a bank gets on deposits known as reserves that it keeps at the federal reserve. The lower limit is determined by overnight reverse repurchases. These are securities like treasury bills, but the federal reserve lends to banks usually for a day while paying interest. On this chart, you can see where the fed has set the target range between the two yellow lines, the blue line, which is the effective federal funds rate set by banks sits between the upper and lower limits as the target range changes the effective rate goes up or down with it - So far they've had very successful control over guiding the federal funds rate and guiding all short-term money market rates to where they generally are trying to move them. - [Narrator] The fed makes these adjustments in fairly small increments. Its rate increases for 2022 are expected to only change by about a quarter to half of a point at a time. So how can these tiny adjustments for banks help cool down the entire economy? It all has to do with how those rates ripple through the system. As banks are charged more to borrow, they'll in turn charge their customers more, affecting the cost of existing loans and demand for new borrowing. The goal of raising these rates is to drive down demand. - Inflation results when supply and demand are outta whack. The fed can't do anything to increase the supply of oil or to increase the number of houses for sale. The supply side is something out of their reach, but they can bring supply and demand by reducing demand. - [Narrator] Here's how rates can influence demand and inflation. When rates are low, more people in businesses are likely to take out loans. Higher demand for goods and services, as well as lower rates allows employers to open more positions to meet demand and raise wages to appeal to potential employees. Consumers then turn around and spend those wages on goods and services, which in turn can lead to more jobs and higher prices. The opposite happens when rates are higher. Fewer people and businesses take out loans, job growth slows, and spending decreases. Higher interest rates may also make it more appealing to save. Inflation slows as supply and demand balance out. While interest rates can be effective in bringing inflation down, a rate hike could take some time to make an impact. - Think about your own life as you go through making different decisions about whether to buy a house and how big of a house to buy. It may take a while for this to ripple through the housing market, for example, but in 6 or 12 months, we could begin to see, you know, less demand if interest rates are high enough to slow interested consumers. - [Narrator] But while inflation may take time to come down, consumers and businesses will likely feel the impact of higher interest rates on loans, mortgages, and credit cards right away."
The Economist,2.0,dgmDcK5wssU,[Music] consumer prices are up interest rates are rising after about a generation global inflation is surging again why have millions of people around the world become exposed to high inflation and what can we do to bring it back under control henry i'm going to start with you what is inflation inflation is a rise in prices uh it's a rise in average prices measured by a basket of goods and services typically it's when everything gets expensive and when you think about that it's important to realize it's not when just one thing gets more expensive that's what we call a change in relative prices it's a change in overall prices why do economists get so exercised about it what happens if we just let inflation kind of do its thing why do we care so if inflation starts creeping up and i think that that's going to last then i might start pushing up you know the wage increase that i would like or the um prices that i would like to set and so what you have what you end up having is a situation where prices start creeping up higher and higher and higher and we know from places where inflation is really high that that has a cost my own view is that it's really more like an on off switch either inflation is low enough that people don't really have to worry about it too much or it's high enough that they pay a lot of attention because they're feeling it every time they buy anything and they have to budget more carefully and all the things that are going on right now and then it really shoots up the scales in terms of its political importance what are the levers that policymakers have to make inflation go up or down well there's been a consensus for about three decades or so that the primary responsibility for controlling inflation is the responsibility of the central bank and that the way in which you control inflation is by raising interest rates when inflation's too high which reduces the amount of spending in the economy reduces the amount of money chasing a limited pool of goods and services which is ultimately what causes people to put their prices up at the moment with inflation too high the real question is how high are central banks going to raise interest rates in order to fight it the next section we're going to is what we're going to do about inflation now um obviously at the moment central banks are raising rates pretty rapidly is this going to cause inflation to come down fairly quickly as the central banks hope i mean that's the question of the day really is how effective central banks are going to be in bringing down inflation the pace of the monetary tightening is pretty steep it's the steepest in america since the early 1980s um so after a period of hesitation it looks like they're taking the problem seriously um the real question now is how much pain that's going to cause i think there's a sort of dirty little secret of monetary economics and that's that the actual mechanisms by which higher interest rates flow through the economy aren't that well understood it wouldn't surprise me if they still have to go significantly higher but i have complete faith in the ability of higher interest rates to bring down inflation ultimately because if you raise rates high enough it will it will as ratchet said cause a cause a recession eventually and that's very effective at bringing inflation down if you're a policy maker now like what else are you or should you be thinking about doing to get inflation expectations down to the extent that inflation is about the balance between demand and supply in the economy you know other policies that reduce aggregate demand would bring inflation down as well and their you know tighter fiscal policy raising taxes reducing spending would bring down prices as well what we're being reminded of right now is just how unpopular inflation is how much people dislike um you know prices pump going up um the feeling that when they go to supermarkets they can afford less and less you know and and that has political consequences and can drive politicians and governments to try to do things to rein in price rises the proof is in the pudding central banks have to deliver the low inflation and then people will believe that inflation is going to be low thanks for watching to read the economist coverage of inflation click on the link and don't forget to subscribe
Financial Times,2.0,cfaubxeS5HU,"The bill I'm about to sign is not just about today. It's about tomorrow. It's about delivering progress and prosperity to American families. The Inflation Reduction Act was the largest investment in clean energy in the history of the world. The Inflation Reduction Act is going to rapidly accelerate our pathway to net zero. A sweeping piece of legislation that is designed to decarbonise the US economy, to reshore supply chains, and also to break dependence on China. It levels the playing field for western producers. It's the largest investment in the history of the United States' solar industry of any kind. The so-called Paris Climate Accord - it's a disaster, a death sentence. It's possible that you could see, in 2024, a re-election of Donald Trump. And at that point, I think all bets would be off. The big question is whether this ends up being a trade war. We thought we were in the era of free-market globalisation. And now we're not. The Inflation Reduction Act is actually a very misleading name because it has very little to do with inflation reduction, particularly in the short term. It's a piece of industrial policy. It's a piece of climate policy. It's a piece of trade policy. It's not a piece of inflation reduction. It's full of tax credits designed to draw in investment into the US economy. And it's all being funded by the federal government over the next 10 years. The IRA includes $370bn worth of tax credits, loans, and grants to incentivise domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration says, you know what? It is important that America makes things. It is important not only that we transition to a greener economy, but it's important to be able to secure supply chains. This is a big shift. This is about a 50-year change in how the economy is going to run. Is this actually going to create long-term viable industries which are more competitive than the Chinese? We have to face the risk that it won't work. And when the subsidies stop, unless they're there forever, the programme won't really have worked. And some of these may turn out to be white elephants. I'm John Podesta. I am overseeing the implementation of the clean-energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and attacking the problem of climate change in the history of the world. The impact on emissions of the IRA are expected to be about 40 per cent cut by 2032 if all the tax credits are taken up. At the heart of it was an economic theory. Invest in American technology and manufacturing, power the economy, reduce the dependency the United States had on unreliable single-source suppliers of certain goods and materials. The Chips and Science Act passed first. It's a much smaller industrial policy. It includes around $52bn to incentivise research in semiconductors as well as stimulate semiconductor production in the United States. It's really, in a way, a partner bit of legislation. It's also about reshoring supply chains. According to FT research, the IRA and the Chips Act together have helped stimulate more than $220bn in manufacturing and clean technologies and semiconductors. This will create more than a hundred thousand jobs. It's clearly designed to tell the world that America is back as a major player in world industry and in the climate fight. Sleepy old America is gone. We've already seen over $115bn of investment in clean manufacturing, over $125bn in utility-scale renewable energy. So you have Arizona that's sucking in money from the Inflation Reduction and the Chips Act, the Midwest states like Ohio, Michigan - upstate New York is taking advantage of this. In the southeast, Georgia - the states that may have been once resistant to clean energy and so on for political reasons. I think what you're seeing in Georgia is a bipartisan embrace of the opportunities and investments in advanced energy manufacturing and electric vehicle manufacturing that are being supercharged by these manufacturing and infrastructure policies. We made the initial investment in the United States in 2018. And we're making a much larger expansion after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. It's about a $2.5bn investment. By the end of next year we're going to collectively employ about 4,000 people directly, across the state. It's the largest investment in the history of the United States solar industry of any kind. We've worked really closely with folks in Georgia and Washington DC over the last five years. The solar manufacturing policies, alongside this broad package of manufacturing incentives, are designed to make Georgia the national and global leader in advanced-energy innovation and manufacturing. Solar technology and solar products are strategic commodities, poly silicon, ingots, wafers, cells, but a significant stranglehold, historically, on the market in China. Our energy security, our energy independence, and our environmental future depend upon our production of these technologies to components in the United States. Solar panels that we make here at this factory are used for both commercial and residential. Now you're going to see where the magic happens. I started my career in manufacturing because I knew I wanted to follow in my parents footsteps, went into textiles-- ladies undergarments. Georgia was not known for advanced manufacturing. Our facility here has transformed the job market. We're keeping students. When they're coming out of school and they're coming to work, they're buying homes here. We want to see the entire supply chain for our product here in Georgia. Products that come out of this facility will contain cells, wafers, and poly silicon that all originated in the United States. A state like Georgia has lots of land. Its labour is relatively cheap. Its governor has been very progressive in terms of offering subsidies on top of the ones that come with the federal Inflation Reduction Act. And developers are arriving in what people are now calling the battery belt in the south. You have Norway's FREYR announcing a $2.6bn factory in Georgia, creating more than 700 jobs. The production-tax credits in the IRA levels the playing field for western producers. The hope is that through the 10 years of the IRA programme, scale has been developed, supply chains get developed. Then western producers can compete one on one with the Chinese producers from that point forward. So our initial project in Georgia, in the US, is called Giga America. We have a site south of Atlanta. The amount of investment will be roughly $2.5bn to $3bn, could go up to around $4.5bn to $5bn. Critics, especially outside the US, have called the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act a new form of protectionism, an extension of what Donald Trump was doing. From this day forward it's going to be only America First. The US is undergoing a bipartisan shift, bringing into America industries in which China is or potentially will be dominant. Biden is doing it through subsidies. Trump did it through tariffs. Now you see companies like General Electric, an American company that absolutely embodied the idea that you could build things more cheaply abroad and then sell them back to Americans. It offshored as much as it could. Now GE is building a new factory in Schenectady, New York. Schenectady, New York, represents a lot of the legacy of General Electric. It's where Edison founded the company. , We're investing $50mn. We're adding 200 union jobs to create what will be the largest onshore wind-and-cell facility in the US. I would like to think that you know they would have picked Schenectady anyways. But probably not. I know the IRA has been a big part of it. So we're in upstate New York. We're probably not the lowest labour rate in the world. It is very good work for the existing skill set that we have, and to bring in all this new blood that can then learn from people who've been building generators and turbines for 30 years. General Electric is an important employer for the Schenectady area, and frankly, depending on what chapter, over the last 20 years, one in which we've been reducing jobs, not adding jobs. I'm actually a third-generation GE Schenectady employee. My grandfather started here in 1952 and retired in the '70s. My father retired after 40 years service in 2010. I worked down the hall with somebody who has five generations. Most of the people in here have a relative who've worked in General Electric. If they're from Schenectady, you know somebody who worked for GE at some point. Schenectady peaked, maybe back in the '60s and '70s, with 40,000 people here. There's still 5,000-plus people on the Schenectady campus. This is by far the biggest investment that I've been a part of in my 26 years here. Factories like to know that there's work in front of them and that they're going to be here for a long time to be sustainable. And to have the business have enough confidence that Schenectady can do this, that we're the right place to put it, is just huge. Developers are listening. They understand that because of these tax credits, they can actually thrive in the US. They can make the profits there. It will have an impact on global trade. It does look protectionist. It is clearly designed to shift production from foreign places to America. And that's ultimately what a lot of protection is designed to do. Some of the architects of globalisation, for example, John Podesta, who is now President Biden's official in charge of the Inflation Reduction Act, he was part of the Clinton administration, opening global markets, and then was part of the Obama administration that did the same, 30 years of American economic policy heading in one direction. Now American policy is about re-industrialising its heartlands even if that means shutting off cheap supplies from elsewhere. It is a fundamentally different approach. We're in conversation with our allies and friends and trading partners, executed a critical minerals agreement with Japan. We have a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. We have a free trade agreement with Korea which permits them to take advantage of some of the provisions of the IRA. We're in deep conversation about doing a critical minerals agreement with Europe. What the Inflation Reduction Act has demonstrated to countries around the world, that they can be part of the solution too. They can make those investments. The Inflation Reduction Act has changed the world. We are really at an inflection point. We're moving from a world that has been globalising, a world in which rich countries have been essentially offshoring and outsourcing production to emerging markets and developing countries. The IRA programme is set up to drive green nationalism. Ronald Reagan's attitude to economic policy and his famous remark, ""the nine most dangerous words in the English language are - I'm from the government and I'm here to help,"" that's just dead, and bipartisan dead. The Biden administration thought that it was rejoining the climate fight. Everybody would welcome leadership from the US. In fact, the reaction, especially in Europe, has been quite hostile. It's pretty clearly a violation of the WTO. You could say by now, the WTO is moribund anyway. Who cares? But it's another nail in the coffin. The basic consensus was that the governments create the rules, the framework within which business operates. But governments aren't actually in the competitive arena with their money. Once you move to a world in which they are, everything becomes very uncertain and unpredictable. And it makes co-operation much more difficult. And these were all the reasons why, after the '30s, we tried to create something like the GATT WTO. So it could be very bad for international relations and the international economy. It got a lot of flak from Europeans, which I found kind of amazing because Europe - and many countries, for example - have been complaining for years that America should do more about climate. This bill does mark a fundamental shift away from the market-knows-best strategy. We're going to say climate change is a war that we have to win. Fighting for a clean-energy future requires industrial strategy. And that's not about the market. That's about the state being an actor in the economy and really pushing change that frankly the market hasn't made in the last three or four decades. It's clearly going to encourage European businesses to invest in America. Indeed, it's already happening. It is making the US look more attractive and be more competitive. They're doing it with the fiscal firepower of a unified federal government. And the Europeans, obviously, find it very difficult to respond to that in aggregate because they don't have a federal fiscal power. The concern, of course, is that the response in Europe will generate a subsidy war within Europe. We've already touched off a subsidy where we have a kind of arms race that's been touched off, a green arms race. Do we need subsidies or economic incentives to develop this industrialisation? Yes. There is a risk of a battle of subsidies, even internally in EU, by the way, because of course, the level of development of countries are different. This race to the bottom in internal subsidies could be fundamentally distorting and even, I think, threaten the single market. Everybody knows who will win that subsidy war. Germany will win it because their fiscal position is so much stronger and they have a bigger domestic market. What the IRA has allowed is the US to take a leadership position in the transition. I think it is something that they're striving for. I don't think it necessarily puts the US in a leadership position until you see the scale get built out. What that does for Europe, I think, is challenges some of the jurisdictions in Europe. It has been a wake-up call for Europe on the industrialisation policy, which was not something that you do at European level. It's not an industrialisation force, as it is not a foreign policy force, because of the nature of the institution is not the federation. Where is the space of competitiveness for Europe? And in some cases, Chinese won already in the battery industry or the electric vehicle industry. We may have space. But we have to define this. Can we do that together with the US or independently? I think that's a big question mark. What I hear from a lot of European companies and I hear from European governments as well, is look, the United States is pushing us. We need to get our act together. We want to see rapid deployment of clean technologies in Europe. That's in the world's interest. And that's why we're in dialogue on things like trying to land a critical minerals agreement. There's every chance that at some point the EU and the US are agree on some shared way to source minerals for the energy transition. But for now, the tensions are at the fore. And they could get much worse. It will create trade tension. It is already creating trade tension. We know that nobody can develop on its own. And we need this balance between openness and national development. So it's a very uncharted waters. It could be very dangerous. We are exactly in the format of the 1914s, more protectionism, more tension, more investment in military. That's not bode well. You could imagine retaliation on one side leads to counter retaliation globally in the context in which there's already very bad relations between the western powers and China, and lead to a very dangerous downward spiral in trade and in international relations. What this legislation is intending to do is to ensure that the United States keeps its commitment on climate. And it'll have a very substantial benefit to the global economy. Make no mistake about it. The investments in the United States, driving down the price, will help economies globally deploy at scale. And it's going to be a major challenge to get these factories built and running. Construction groups think the sector needs to fill another 500,000 new jobs just in the next year alone, more labourers than the US actually has available. Quite how the administration fixes that problem is unknown. So what does the Biden administration do then? Does it soften the terms for local labour and so on? Does it start to turn a blind eye to the import of wafers from China for solar panels, for example? I think this obsession, we have to reduce dependence on China, again, can be understood but cannot be an objective in itself. Sometime nationalism is blurring the rational thinking. China remains the factory of the world. For all these parts that will be critical in batteries and solar, China controls almost all of the anodes, the cathodes for batteries. It controls almost all of the lithium processing. It builds almost all the wafers that are used in solar panels. China will remain a dominant supplier to the US and everywhere else in many essential areas. It's really impossible to cut it out. And at some point, I think the Biden administration will have to come to an answer about whether they prioritise the cutting of emissions and doing all this cheaply, which probably means more supplies from countries like China, or whether it really is about re-industrialisation and the climate targets can be delayed. We can't keep the 1.5 objective of global-warming temperature as a limit if we don't do technological co-operation. We need Chinese capacity. If we operate in a very fluid economic environment without this trade tension, we will achieve the climate goal more quickly. To create a transformation in the industrial system, you have to distort markets. One of the big challenges is that once you start doing that you create political allies that want that distortion to continue. American producers of solar panels are more expensive than their overseas competitors. That, along with a bunch of supply-chain issues, means that US buyers of solar power are paying more money than their competitors overseas. That's, over the long term, not good for the green transition because it makes a very promising technology more expensive. I think the Europeans relied on cheap fossil fuels or at least lower-priced fossil fuels from Russia. They regretted that at the end of the day after Russia violated international law and invaded Ukraine. This idea that cheapest is always best opens you up to economic security problems. In the next 20 to 30 years, we need to fully decarbonise. That's going to require a guide and a market guide from government and private investments to work. That's what we see happening right now with the Inflation Reduction Act. China is now the largest emitter in the world, almost double the size of the United States. The United States remains the world's historic largest emitter. We both have to do more. Competition can be healthy in this sector too. It can drive down costs. It can lead to innovation. I think it's also important to realise that it was passed in the follow up of the pandemic, in which supply chains around the world were completely strained. Our supply chains, here in the United States, are going to be as low carbon as it gets because we're getting our poly silicon from a facility in Washington state which has a high degree of hydropower that's powering its grid, meaning that the embedded carbon in the products that we produce here will also be lowered. There are big questions about how the IRA will impact the Global South. The understandable complaint from emerging markets is hey, western world, you had your fun. You had 100 years of polluting. And now you want to change everything. And we have to pay the price even though we don't get the same level of development. And that's a very legitimate criticism. There are countries like Chile, which was a leader in green hydrogen or was poised to become a leader in green hydrogen. Chile can't afford the subsidies that the US has. So its natural advantage of abundant renewable energy has been wiped out. US, like Europe and others, have to buy a lot of critical materials that for the moment are mostly controlled by China. It's not possible just to consider only the national interest and not the necessity for developing countries to, in a way, develop their own industry, and not a new model we have to invent. If not, we will have a lot of tension and a lot of blockage and a lot of competition from China or others. And I don't think we necessarily will win this competition. You could imagine the US and Europe bringing countries in Africa and Latin America into a new trade paradigm where they say, hey, we will help fund some of the clean transition in exchange for guarantees of critical minerals. That's what the IRA does. It says fundamentally, we are going to need some politics, some statecraft, as part of the climate transition. And we're not going to be able to just come up with a carbon price and expect the Global South to pay for it. The climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state. It's an existential threat. One of the other really fascinating features of the investment that we are seeing since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act is that 80 per cent of the money is going to Republican districts. It is very ironic when Republicans didn't support the IRA and few Republicans supported the Chips Act. Maybe not so good news for the Democrats if they can't take the credit for creating those jobs. The so-called Paris Climate Accord - it's a disaster, a death sentence. It's possible that you could see, in 2024, a re-election of Donald Trump. And at that point, I think all bets would be off. One of the really important features of the Inflation Reduction Act, according to developers and their lawyers when they look at the fine print, is that the tax credits are embedded in the legislation for 10 years. Quite how a future Republican government could unpick them is yet to be seen. Will all of it stay? Probably not. Will there be a big effort by the by a second Trump administration to roll back a lot of regulation, put judges in place that don't want the administrative state to have so much power? Absolutely. So there's going to be a lot of chaos. But the president is the president. And if you saw someone like Trump come in and simply just use all the tools of the executive office to make it very difficult to get things done, then yeah, I think that that would be a real headwind. When the Affordable Care Act originally passed it was unpopular. As people understood that Obamacare was really delivering, it became popular. And I think that will happen with regard to these investments when the jobs are created, when steel is in the ground. The Inflation Reduction Act has put a line in the sand with a post-neoliberal politics in which the market doesn't always know best. There comes a time when the government has a role to play in ensuring public goods, like dealing with global warming. There are big challenges. I won't kid you. We've got permitting challenges. We've got supply-chain challenges, interest-rate challenges. We're investing in this country, we're building things again, that will deal with the environmental consequences of generations of over reliance on fossil fuels. It won't go close to actually achieving net zero globally. Much of the other things that are needed are going to be far more politically difficult than this. There is nobody operating in the clean-energy sector or in the semiconductor sector who thinks that the US can do it alone. Nobody. America does not have all of the means to control all of the supply chains for the clean energy revolution, period. It will be seen as revolutionary in the general view we have of what the western world thinks the right way of doing economic policy is. The Americans, real advocates of free markets and free trade, have said we are going to do it in a different way. I don't think that can happen in the US without changing everything. America has been the exemplar and the shaper of the world order ever since the second world war. We thought we were in the era of free-market globalisation. And now we're not."
TRT World,2.0,iMu1eVmuKHw,the rising cost of goods is raising alarm across europe as economies recover from pandemic losses the eurozone annual inflation rate surged to more than twice the european central bank's target hitting 4.1 percent in october 2021 this is the highest figure since the great recession of 2008 energy costs were hit the hardest by rising inflation reaching 23.5 percent in october cost of services experienced inflation by 2.1 percent and food prices rose by two percent this year the highest annual inflation rates across eurozone members were seen in lithuania with eight point two percent estonia was seven point four percent and latvia was six percent germany the largest european economy was hit by 4.6 inflation the surge has resulted from higher energy prices which are six times more than last year europe's energy sector is dominated by natural gas and its price has also risen by 380 percent since the start of the year a longer and colder winter than usual in 2020 with rising numbers of people working from home a higher demand for natural gas from china and other asian countries a global trend of economy shifting away from fossil fuel use and supply shortages due to covid19 have all contributed to the rising prices although the most significant sources of natural gas for europe norway and russia have both seen their production output reduced this year the rising demand for electricity contributed to the rising gas prices as over a fifth of europe's electricity comes from natural gas furthermore economies faced a worldwide chip shortage crisis as global supply chains slowed due to covet 19. producers have been caught off guard by this year's rebound after they cut back material orders last year when consumers reduce spending during the pandemic
CGTN Europe,2.0,BmDRsJYWAHs,the interest rate set by central banks governs how much they need to pay commercial Banks who deposit money when the Central Bank raises its rate commercial Banks do the same meaning they pay more to Savers but charge more for Lending money out to Borrowers higher borrowing costs mean people and businesses have less to spend and more incentive to save the aim is to encourage vendors to keep prices low to attract customers whose spending power has been reduced if this works this will bring down inflation
KGW News,2.0,dxmTJDFsbxM,welcome back if you've been to the grocery store or the gas station or anywhere where you literally buy anything recently you probably noticed something and that's that stuff costs more and of course there is a word for this it's inflation that's how economists refer to an increase in the price of goods and services one of the ways we measure inflation is via the consumer price index basically economists look at the price of everyday things that people buy things like groceries gas clothes they bundle all of that together and they see how prices change over time so in the west region which includes oregon prices are up six percent from october of last year so something that costs a hundred dollars last year might cost 106 dollars today and you might be thinking that doesn't sound like a lot and there's no way that gas prices are only up six percent and you're right remember six percent refers to the average for all prices in this fixed bundle of goods and services but inflation has hit some industries way harder than others meat and poultry prices are up almost 15 percent from october of last year it's something you might have noticed when you bought your thanksgiving turkey and if you bought a used car recently you're definitely feeling it too those prices are up more than 26 from this time last year and something we've heard from a lot of you gas prices are skyrocketing up nearly 43 percent since october of 2020. so the question is why is this happening and more importantly how do we make it stop so we asked josh laner an economist with the state of oregon what is causing this rise in prices and you know as you might have learned back in high school if you were paying better attention than me it has to do with supply and demand we're spending 15 more than we used to and so that means our supply chains are struggling not because they're moving record volumes of goods and delivering them to our doorstep but we're trying to buy even more than we can deliver so that's one of those root causes so it's really supply chain bottlenecks because the consumer demand is so strong should have said paid better attention than i that was good in english class that's embarrassing in other words though we are buying things faster than suppliers can make them and get them to us and that's obviously making things more expensive labor is hard to find materials cost more and we all pay the price so how long could this last well actually laner seems cautiously optimistic well i think you know we're going to see inflation sort of peak and come down i think as as those supply chain bottlenecks get fixed a little bit certainly on the other side of the holiday shopping season uh the question is where does it ultimately settle right the federal reserve would like to see it settle at two percent uh if it settles in that two or three percent range i think you know we'll we'll go on about our economic lives if it settles more in the four or five percent range um then then we have an interesting situation where the federal reserve may have to step in and raise rates faster than anticipated to cool off the economy so that may not be much relief to you watching at home every day things we all need to survive are more expensive and we're all feeling it but you know we put a post out on facebook just to let everybody vent a little bit and we asked you where you've noticed the rise in prices the most brad said bread coffee i gaze occasionally in the meat market chicken and pork remain affordable but beef i won't be throwing a steak on the grill anytime soon yeah we don't blame you
Yahoo Finance,2.0,Fvn2dxtByGs,i love you know the republic saying it's biden's gas pipeline but by biden said he's going to stop the keystone pipeline and i did and that's the reason prices went up folks let's get something straight here the keystone pipeline was two years away it had been two percent finished give me a break
KTVB,2.0,CJUbXY5KqgU,inflation is the highest it's been in four decades which has cause for alarm and reason for lawmakers to address it head-on and in the two days since senate democrats passed the inflation reduction act and sent it to the house for its deliberation we've heard all the snippets and sound bites on how the bill is not really what they say it is of course nearly all of that talk is coming from those who voted against it like idaho senators mike crapo and jim risch they say despite its name the 700 page bill is not about reducing inflation but just increasing taxes and scrutiny over who is paying them president biden promised those increased taxes would not be imposed on those making less than 400 thousand a year critics say the president is wrong and the act will actually raise taxes on everyone senator risch claiming such in his explanation on why he voted against it on sunday these tax hikes won't affect just the highest tax bracket americans making as little as 30 thousand dollars per year will pay more to federal government because of this bill and senator crapo saying nearly the same thing a week ago and during the 10-year period the average tax burden increases would increase for nearly every income category crapo by the way quoting the joint committee on taxation who put out the review of the bill a committee on which grepo happens to sit well those two statements solicited these questions from you laura asking us to explain senator crapo's comment that anyone making thirty thousand or more on taxes on or will have their taxes increased under the bill where is he seeing this increase rick wanting us to tell him how the act will impact families that have thirty thousand dollar income as rishi stated and kim what can you please fact check rish's comment about nude act about the new act increasing taxes for folks as low as 30 000 well we reached out to both senators crapo and risch and neither responded to our questions or requests for an interview but chief political reporter joe perez was able to speak with a boise accountant to in fact fact checked fact check those claims about taxes going up for those making less than 400 thousand a year national conversation continues to center on the inflation reduction act and depending on what side of the aisle you're on you may hear two very different conversations a major question though about the act does it keep the promise of president joe biden who said the act would not raise taxes on people making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year critics say no supporters say yes so we went nonpartisan for an analysis on the act boise cpa jeff beebe says he expects calls soon from clients i will this week once it really starts getting into the press i'll have people start to call me a major question he will likely get how will this act impact taxes we asked bibi to explain some of the language inside of it we cash rates aren't changing as part of the the uh act but there are some things that for corporations are raising taxes which they'll end up passing through to consumers so while you may not be paying taxes directly you'll be paying more for it while the individual tax rates for those making less than four hundred thousand dollars doesn't change the act does include a new 15 percent minimum tax on corporations that earn more than a billion dollars in annual profits the tax works to focus on some 200 u.s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some companies that end up paying no taxes at all due to clever maneuvering experts say don't expect the major corporations to bite the bullet on paying new taxes you take amazon as an example very early on amazon didn't make any money for years so they had a big net operating loss carryover that they've been using up now that they're profitable but it still is an offset that was legal to use but very unpopular politically so it's focused on companies like that or that they're reinvesting large amounts of their income into other things that are deductions they don't want all these deductions getting away they're not going to just take a hit to the bottom line they're going to pass it through to consumers so what could that look like usually it would be a a price increase it might be lowering the rate of wage increases although with our current environment of tight employment you can't mess with people's wages too much it's going to be in price increase so while tax rates might not change low and medium earning americans could see a cost associated with the new act but tax credits built into the act for things like green energy and electric cars or medicare benefits well those also are supposed to offset those costs bibi says he's also watching another part of the act an 80 billion dollar investment into the internal revenue service the irs the goal is to crack down on dishonest tax filings that cost the country millions of dollars well they're talking about hiring up to 80 000 employees which is almost doubling the size of the irs and which will make a big impact on irs audits the irs has kind of a tough job they enforce a very unpopular law everybody understands that the government needs money to operate they just don't want it to be my money i want to be somebody else's money so the irs has more resources i guess the logic here would be okay less less under reporting right yeah they'll go after that under reporting and that's under reporting from individuals is 250 billion it's much larger for from individuals than corporations or payroll taxes and who's that going to go to that's mostly going to be people that make under four hundred thousand dollars a year again that's on a tax increase because that's tax law that exists it's just people are paying it and the irs is going to try and collect it it'll be focused on people making it under 400 000 because there are more more of those people than there are over 400 000 and there's a lot of i guess intricacy to get into this entire thing and of course we don't have time to go through it right now but if you wanted to read more and i recommend you do go to our website right now ktvb.com we have an explanation of what's in the act how it works why it works that way as well as we track this whole thing through brian it's important to know this is non-god to the pri the president's desk that still technically has to pass another house over in congress when the president does sign it that would start triggering you know differences for cpas across the country they're going to have to look at things but we'll wait and watch for now and again we'd love to sit down with senators crepe and rich to find out get a little bit more explanation as to why they voted no and why they're saying the saying the things they're saying about it all right thanks joe
The Wall Street Journal,2.0,7x8vIvwYzFg,"- [Presenter] Few things in the economy are more closely watched than bond yields. - There are forces in play that merit watching. Some commodity prices and 10-year treasury yields have climbed. - [Presenter] That's the president of The Federal Reserve of Atlanta last March speaking about how The Fed gauges inflation and why it's keeping a close eye on certain bond yields. US government bond yields are a barometer for the economy, but they're also more than that. - US government bond yields are extremely important to the US and even in the global economy. Bond yields affect everything from the cost of a mortgage to the cost of borrowing for businesses. If you're borrowing money, that's gonna be determined to a large extent by US government bond yields. - [Presenter] And changes in yields can impact you. Here's how bond yields work and why they're so crucial to the economy. (bright music) When we talk about a bond yield, we're typically talking about the annualized return an investor earns by holding a bond until its maturity date. Let's break this down. A bond is a contract with features that are set from the start. There's the maturity date, which refers to the length of the bond's life. This is generally two to 30 years. Bonds that mature between two and 10 years are also called notes. Then there's it's face value, which is the amount the bond is worth when it's first created and the amount it is guaranteed to pay on the maturity date. There's also the annual interest rate, otherwise known as the coupon rate. This is the fixed amount a bond pays each year up to its maturity date. So say an investor buys a new 10-year treasury note with a face value of $1,000 and a coupon or yield of 4%. Every year, the investor will receive $40 and on the 10th year, she'll get back the original $1,000 she paid for the bond. But here's the thing, as soon as she buys that bond, she can sell it to other investors and when she does certain features of the bond are subject to change. If the economy is doing well, interest rates may go up, which means new bonds will be issued at a higher yield, bringing down the value of existing bonds. Say a new batch of 10 year treasuries pay a yield of 5%. Suddenly this bond is less attractive to investors and the price has dropped. When the price goes down, the yield goes up and when interest rates go down, this same dynamic happens in reverse. The inverse relationship between the price of a bond and it's yield is key to understanding why investors care so much about bond yields and why you sometimes see yields and stocks both going up at the same time. - Investors generally like bonds because they are a safe investment. The problem is that that return is gonna be often lower, much lower than stocks. - [Presenter] Sam Goldfarb covers changes in bond yields and how they're connected to financial markets and the economy. - If investors are confident about the economy, they might not be satisfied with the small return they can get from US government bonds. They might choose to buy stocks instead. - [Presenter] But climbing treasury yields also signal that borrowing is getting more expensive. - It's basically a proxy for longer-term interest rates. If you want to get a rough sense of, you know, where your mortgage rates are gonna be going, you might look at the 10-year treasury note and it's yield. - [Presenter] Bond yields aren't just watched by economists and investors. The Federal reserve keeps a close eye on them as well. And they're not just watching. Bond yields are a key part of monetary policy that The Fed uses to help influence the economy. - There has been an underlying sense of an improved economic outlook, and that has to be part of why rates would move back up from the extraordinarily low levels they were at. - [Presenter] That's the chairman of The Federal reserve in March, 2021, talking about the rise in bond yields during the economic crisis. In 2020, The Fed had slashed short-term interest rates at controls to zero in an effort to bolster the economy and encourage spending. And bond yields, which are heavily influenced by the outlook of short-term interest rates also fell to record lows. Two years later, much of the economy has rebounded. - The economy has rapidly gained strength despite the ongoing pandemic, giving rise to persistent supply and demand imbalances and bottlenecks and to elevated inflation. - [Presenter] Last December inflation rose 7% from a year earlier. The fastest pace since 1982. This reflected rapidly rising prices on everything from houses to groceries. And when The Fed wants to restrain an overheated economy, it raises short-term interest rates. And when interest rates rise, bond yields go up as well. - If inflation is uncomfortably high, people don't like that. The Fed has a goal of keeping prices stable and so it'll try to cool the economy by raising borrowing costs. - [Presenter] Higher interest rates can send up the price of mortgages and other loans, which will likely slow down consumer spending. This sounds like a bad thing, but only to a point. Higher bond yields can help cool down the economy, which should bring down inflation in the longterm."
CNBC International,2.0,mEBU0QkhYNI,"Rising costs and higher interest rates. It’s hard to talk about the economy these days without thinking of one word: Inflation. But as many countries across the globe battle sky-high inflation, here in Switzerland, a small mountainous nation in western Europe, the rise in prices has been far less dramatic. Have you felt the effect of price rises and inflation over the past year? Um, not that much to be honest. It’s been all right. Most of the things, it’s OK. You think Switzerland’s somehow got it more right than maybe other places? I think so. Inflation in Switzerland hit a 29-year high of 3.5% in 2022. While still high by Swiss standards, it is well below the double-digit inflation rates in other advanced economies like the U.S., U.K. and euro zone. So, what is it about the Swiss economy that means it has largely avoided rampant inflation, and what can other countries learn from it? There are multiple parts to Switzerland’s inflationary story. For starters, prices in the country are already beginning from a high base. Switzerland is one of the world’s wealthiest countries, with a GDP per capita outstripping that of other major economies like the U.S., Japan and Germany. It is also home to some of the richest citizens in the world, with an average wealth of nearly $700,000 per adult — and a steep cost-of-living to match. In 2022, the Swiss cities of Zurich and Geneva held steady among the world’s 10 most expensive cities, even as inflation pushed up living costs in other pricey places like Singapore, New York and Tel Aviv. Tobias Straumann is a professor of modern and economic history at the University of Zurich. It’s because people are on average quite rich, the share of food in the overall budget of households is not as big as maybe in other countries. We also have inequality, of course. But, from an international perspective, we have I think a very well-functioning social policy. As a result, Swiss citizens are generally less impacted by price hikes because they tend to spend a lower proportion of their income on essentials versus discretionary items such as vacations and hobbies, which they can scale back when prices go up. Another reason for Switzerland’s relative price stability stems from the strong Swiss franc. The country’s currency has also steadily strengthened, rising in value against the euro to reach parity in 2022. And while the U.S. dollar strengthened against many major currencies in 2022, the Swiss franc held steady amid volatility in Europe. That’s largely due to its status as a “safe haven” currency or defensive asset. The Swiss franc is heavily backed by large reserve of gold, bonds and financial assets, which help the Swiss National Bank ensure the currency’s stability during times of volatility. It’s always been a safe haven currency in times of crisis, and it actually started about 100 years ago, after World War I. And of course, with the war and all that, and Covid, the Swiss franc again was in much demand. The strength of its currency is also beneficial for its economy, which is heavily dependent on international trade. In 2020, Switzerland imported around $300 billion worth of goods and services, the majority of which come from neighboring EU countries. A stronger Swiss franc therefore provides an effective discount on those imports. In the same year, Switzerland exported a near equal amount. But those tended to be higher value goods and services, such as watches and pharmaceuticals, which are less susceptible to price fluctuations than low margin, mass produced commodities. Switzerland is also less exposed to some volatile external factors that pushed prices higher in 2022, such as soaring oil and gas prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Home to around 1,500 lakes and numerous rivers, hydropower plays a key role in Switzerland’s energy production. Hydroelectricity accounts for more than a tenth of Switzerland’s energy consumption, making the country less reliant on oil and gas imports than some of its European neighbors. Swiss energy suppliers are also largely publicly owned, which means they are less exposed to extreme market volatility through financial safety nets but are also subject to more strict pricing regulation. In Switzerland, we have a lot of state control of prices, which is kind of strange because you think of Switzerland as a very liberal country. But in the crucial areas, like energy and rent, you have a lot of public controls. That means that the inflation rate is stretched over time. It doesn’t mean that there’s no inflation at all, but you can avoid that you have a certain short-term effect. At the end of 2022, energy prices in Switzerland rose at a rate of 16.2%; below the levels faced by major peers like Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Italy. Switzerland’s energy regulator now expects prices to rise by a further 27% in 2023, with the typical annual household energy bill topping 1,215 Swiss francs. Jean-Claude Huber is the manager of Hotel Piz Buin Klosters in the east of Switzerland. He said standardization of long-term energy contracts have sheltered businesses like his from rising costs in 2023. This year, I’m not worried because the contract is still the end of the year. Afterwards, it will go up by multiple of five, probably, so that’s really a big increase. But, OK, we’ll have to manage that. The four-star hotel’s dynamic pricing structure also means that Huber has been able to pass on price hikes of around 5-10% to the consumer without hurting demand. We can absorb it, we can play with the rates much more than if you have fixed rates all the time, and that helps us a lot. If you take two- or three-star hotels, they will have much more problems because these people are very much more sensitive on the costs. Alongside energy, Switzerland also has stringent controls on the price of goods and services, making them less susceptible to inflation-led fluctuations. Of the core products used to measure inflation in the euro zone, including food, housing and transport, almost one-third are subject to price regulation in Switzerland — more than any other European country. High tariffs on certain agricultural imports also mean that domestically produced foods, such as milk and cheese, are preferentially priced and less impacted by movements in global food markets. We try to buy as much as possible Swiss, but even regional, which really means bread, milk products and so on, to buy them locally. Long-term, you want to have a local industry working, functioning. And you need farmers, so it’s important that they can sell their products. In December of 2022, Swiss food prices rose at an annualized rate of 4.0%. That compares with 11.9% in the U.S., 16.9% in the U.K., and 19.8% in Germany. At the restaurant, the food costs we can adapt very easily in increasing the cost of the meals. But we’re cautious also, because you shouldn’t exaggerate. All of that doesn’t mean Swiss consumers have been totally immune to recent price hikes, however. In fact, some say they are feeling the pinch more than ever. So, where have you felt it most? Energy prices, electricity. Some groceries have gotten more expensive. As usual, it’s the poor people or the low wages that suffer from it, and they really have a problem. Switzerland’s central bank said it now expects inflation to dip to an average of 2.4% in 2023 before falling to 1.8% in 2024. Even if we have a kind of recessionary scenario, people are still coming in, and that of course stabilizes demand. And I expect the same thing for this year, 2023, and probably also for 2024. What, if anything, do you think other countries can learn from the Swiss model? Exchange rate policy is very difficult to imitate, because we have the euro, and the euro has to consider all countries. And I think for some countries an appreciation may be good for import prices but really bad for export. This question about who owns energy production. Maybe it’s a good idea to think about to renationalize at least part of it to be more resilient and to have a long-term owner who really looks for the consumer. In other places in Europe, there was a clear shift to privatization and, in the medium to short-term, that was a very good idea, but it’s not very resilient and they are haunted by these decisions now. At the time, many people said the Swiss are too conservative. But I’d say in retrospect it was a very good decision."
Yahoo Finance,2.0,YD0qsufuf2E,so i was playing guitar and thinking about inflation like i usually do and it's kind of crazy to think that there are many reasons for inflation for example there's cost push inflation where if the wood for example on a guitar gets more expensive than the guitar manufacturer can pass that along as a cost increase to consumers but there's also something called demand poll inflation where if me and a bunch of other people want to buy guitars we might be willing to pay a higher price which means that the guitar manufacturer can meet us at that higher price point and that might be a good thing because it means that people are healthy and they can consume and the company could get more money to pay a higher wage to their worker but of course you don't want runaway inflation like we had in the 1970s where double-digit inflation was very quickly eroding people's purchasing power so it just goes to show that there's a lot of nuance to inflation
LX News,2.0,SNg81S3mBSU,showing the consumer price index that's basically follows inflation it spiked to 4.2 percent compared to where we were a year ago that the economy is stronger but inflation also is much higher than expected and not as transitory monexica says inflation will be the number one market driver through year end inflation inflation inflation you hear that word everywhere these days but what does it actually mean let's save you a google search and answer what is inflation the technical explanation is a general systematic increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money but that's kind of technical so the short version is inflation happens when prices go up over time and the purchasing power of a dollar goes down inflation is a process of repeated ongoing increases across a broad set of prices it's not a one-time increase in prices for example you know if the price of tomatoes were to rise five percent because of a freeze that's not inflation it's also not a narrow set of prices going up for example you know prices of new or used cars going up because of a semiconductor shortage inflation is broad and it's repeated year after year so it's more of a process than a one-time shift the big difference here is it's more than noticing a single price increase everything starts to cost more so your money doesn't go as far some inflation is normal it doesn't hurt consumers if wages are going up by the same amount if wages are not going up by the same amount it does reduce purchasing power and and so what that means is consumers might have to cut back spending on other items or they may save less if their wages are not increasing at the same pace as inflation but i'd like to emphasize that some inflation actually is healthy and in fact the fed targets the federal reserve targets a moderate but positive amount of inflation which is two percent on an annual basis inflation is calculated using something called consumer price indexes that's basically how much more you're paying for the stuff you buy regularly over a period of time it's a so-called basket of consumer goods so what's in the basket it's things like housing costs basic food and drinks transportation health and personal care and things you spend money on for fun too so how does what we're seeing now compared to other times in history one good example that has some parallel to now is immediately after world war ii when we saw a surge in prices in the global economy the the global economy was recovering really fast it needed a lot of materials to rebuild that inflation didn't last prices leveled off or fell back as the economy recovered and so in many ways the supply chain issues that we're seeing now after the global economy basically shut down and then reopened are similar to that dynamic that we saw after world war ii the fed says the inflation we're seeing now is temporary because of the pandemic and i would say it's just very difficult for a complex global economy to go from completely shut down to operating on all cylinders and the pandemic has just caused a lot of you know congestion which is driving up shipping costs so the further we move away from the pandemic the more the economy will be able to adjust and we're likely to see some of these prices either stop going down stop going up excuse me or even go back down and inflation will slow you know inflation is one side effect of you know the the disruptions related to the pandemic but i think we should also think about how this recovery has been faster and stronger than prior recoveries it's come with more inflation but it's been faster and stronger and that's a really important point and and that's why we have higher inflation right now inflation is a scary word but as the pandemic eases there should be fewer uh disruptions and companies have every incentive to fix supply chain issues and restore smooth functioning to the economy you
The I Paper,2.0,UZIFvCCSNcY,"Interest rates are rising in the UK again. But what does this obscure number decided by a group of economists actually mean for you? Here's a clue. There's much more to it than just rising mortgage payments. This is what the governor of the Bank of England had to say on the 3rd of November. We've increased bank rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3%. To put this into context, this was the biggest single interest rate rise since the fall of the Berlin Wall and will have a huge impact on the entire British economy. So why are they rising? We've had years of low rates and cheap borrowing. First things first. One of the main issues here is inflation. But what the hell is down to understand what interest rates do? It's first important to understand inflation. Though most of us will find that the cost of products when you go to the supermarket, the cost of our energy bills, the cost of our housing is all increased. And that's that's due to these inflationary pressures. Let's dig a little deeper. Inflation is hitting household budgets across the board, but families food budgets are being hit particularly hard. i journalist Katie Grant has analysed the price of the humble tomato. What does the staple food be loved by so many around the world? Tell us about inflation. When we're looking at inflation. It can be quite useful to look at something very specific that we probably have enough fridges hours. Previously they actually went up just sort of incrementally in price each year in the 12 months to September 2020 to the price of a kilogram of tomatoes went up by about 22%. Tomatoes are really energy intensive products to grow. They're grown in greenhouses. We all know what our energy bills at home. Prices are going up, wages have gone up, there are labor shortages in the UK and growers need to be more competitive in terms of what they're paying their staff. And then finally, the transportation of getting that to wholesalers and into supermarkets is going up because as we know, fuel prices are very high at the moment. So when the price of food rises along with so many other products, we need to survive. Whose responsibility is it to try and shield us from these rising costs? Enter one of our main players, the Bank of England. The Bank of England is our central bank here in the UK. It has an important role in keeping inflation at just 2% enough for the economy to grow, but still low enough that your household finances don't take a huge hit. So how do they maintain financial stability? That's where interest rates come in. The bank sets what's called the bank rate. Probably one of the most important numbers in the British economy. The bank rate affects how high street banks, price borrowing and rewards for savings. Having a direct impact on what you or I pay for mortgages and loans. This is the lever that the bank will pull to affect inflation. The bank's monetary policy committee, made up of nine members led by the bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, reviews the bank rate around every six weeks and they've been steadily increasing the rate recently. It's something we haven't seen for quite some time. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more lucrative. The theory goes that this will encourage people to spend less. Lowering demand for goods and services, eventually pulling down inflation. You essentially reduce the supply of credit to the whole economy in one fell swoop. When people save, as they're incentivised to do through higher interest rates, the less money they have in their pockets to spend in shops, on goods and services across the economy. That decreases the rate at which prices rise. And that's what the Bank of England's intention is through. Increasing interest rates at the moment affects businesses ability to borrow, to grow their businesses and invest in the economy. If it affects homeowners ability to keep the roof over their head and also it diminishes their ability to spend money on other areas of the economy and invest in their own local economies by buying goods and services locally because their household budgets have been squeezed. Same goes for private renters. Okay, so the Bank of England are entirely responsible for the squeeze on people who have a mortgage or rent the home from someone who does hold up. Not so simple. While they do decide the bank rate, which has an impact on the interest rates we have access to. There are other players in this and there are many factors outside their control. Remember that 2% target of inflation the bank is trying to maintain that is set by the government and indeed most countries around the world aim for 2% as it's seen as a healthy balance for a stable economy. But keeping to 2% is a tricky task, and the Bank of England aren't in control of all the factors globally. Putin's war in Ukraine has had a big impact. Russia is a key supplier of oil and gas, and Ukraine is a key transit route for much of that oil and gas to European markets. So the price for oil and gas have gone up. Markets have reacted to this uncertainty by adding a risk premium. So prices go up even more. That puts off our household bills and the prices of many products such as tomatoes. Driving inflation. This is clearly not something the Bank of England could do something about. But then there are domestic issues the Bank of England does have a role in. Liz Truss’s mini-Budget promised a major round of tax cuts which would have put more money in people's pockets, but that would have encouraged them to spend just as the Bank of England was trying to slow down people's spending to curb inflation. In the market turmoil that followed the mini-Budget. The bank helped stabilise the economy. It rushed to buy government debt to bring stability to the markets, while also giving a statement on its plans to tackle inflation by, you guessed it, raising interest rates. Truss's plans have now been can buy a successor Rishi Sunak, but the interest rate increases issued in the wake of the mini budget remain. And with inflation running around 10%, this could mean even more rate hikes on the horizon. If inflation increases, we can certainly expect to see further increases in interest rates. But irrespective of that, almost all forecasts at the moment point to much higher interest rates over the next 12 months or so. This would have been happening anyway, in all likelihood, but the rate of those increases has been sped up quite significantly by last month's disastrous fiscal statement. So I think households and people across the country can really expect to see interest rates rise and at least for the time being. Inflation to also be very, very high. Raising interest rates is a tricky balancing act, and often the Bank of England is looking to the future to see what will be needed rather than responding directly to events on the day. If the Bank of England rises, interest rates too quickly, it's like slamming the brakes on the economy. This could tip us backwards into a recession. However, if rates rise too slowly, inflation could pick up a momentum and remain high for longer and become harder to hold. With the cost of goods becoming more unhinged from people's earnings, still, there's no denying interest rates can be a blunt instrument to keep inflation low. Those with large debts, such as mortgages or loans, will feel the impact acutely, while those with cash to spare will benefit from higher interest rates on their savings. This could increase wealth inequality in the UK. People like you are waking up to the fact that borrowing is not going to be cheap forever. Interest rates are rising in almost every major economy from Norway to South Korea. But if it's one thing history shows us is that periods of high inflation cause major political instability. We're in for quite the ride. [Music] interest rates are rising in the UK again but what does this obscure number decided by a group of economists actually mean for you here's a clue there's much more to it than just Rising mortgage payments this is what the governor of the bank of England had to say on the 3rd of November we've increased bank rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3 percent into context this was the biggest single interest rate rise since the fall of the Berlin wall and will have a huge impact on the entire British economy so why are they Rising we've had years of low rates and cheap borrowing first things first one of the main issues here is inflation but what the hell is that to understand what interest rates do it's first important to understand inflation so most of us will find that the cost of products when we go to the supermarket the cost of our energy bills the cost of our housing has all increased and that's that's due to these inflationary pressures let's dig a Little Deeper inflation is hitting household budgets across the board but families food budgets are being hit particularly hard I journalist Katie Grant has analyzed the price of the humble tomato what does this staple food beloved by so many around the world tell us about inflation when we're looking at inflation it can be quite useful to look at something very specific that we all probably have in our fridges whereas previously they actually went up just sort of incrementally in price each year in the 12 months to September 2022 the price per kilogram of tomatoes went up by 22 tomatoes are really energy intensive um product to grow their grown-in greenhouses we we all know with our energy bills at home prices are going up wages have gone up there are labor shortages in the UK and Growers need to be more competitive in terms of what they're paying their staff and then finally the transportation of getting that to wholesalers and into supermarkets is going up because as we know fuel prices are very high at the moment so when the price of Food rises along with so many other products we need to survive whose responsibility is it to try and shield us from these Rising costs enter one of our main players the bank of England the bank of England is our Central Bank here in the UK it has an important role in keeping inflation at just two percent enough for the economy to grow but still low enough that your household finances don't take a huge hit so how do they maintain Financial stability that's where interest rates come in the bank sets What's called the bank rate probably one of the most important numbers in the British economy the bank rate affects How High Street Banks price borrowing and rewards for savings having a direct impact on what you or I pay for our mortgages and Loans this is the lever that the bank will pull to affect inflation the bank's monetary policy committee made up of nine members led by the bank's Governor Andrew Bailey reviews the bank rate around every six weeks and they've been steadily increasing the rate recently it's something we haven't seen for quite some time higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more lucrative the theory goes that this will encourage people to spend less lowering demand for goods and services eventually pulling down inflation you essentially reduce the supply of credit to the whole economy in one fail swoop so when people save as they're incentivized to do through higher interest rates the less money they have in their pockets to spend in shops on goods and services across the economy that decreases the rate at which prices rise and that's what the bank of England's intention is for increasing interest rates at the moment affects businesses ability to borrow to grow their businesses and invest in the economy it affects homeowners ability to keep the roof over their head and also diminishes their ability to spend money on other areas of the economy and invest in their own local economies by buying goods and services locally because their household budgets have been squeezed same goes for private renters okay so the bank of England are entirely responsible for the squeeze on people who have a mortgage or rent their home from someone who does hold up not so simple while they do decide the bank rate which has an impact on the interest rates we have access to there are other players in this and there are many factors outside their control remember that two percent Target of inflation the bank is trying to maintain that is set by the government and indeed most countries around the world aim for two percent as it's seen as a healthy balance for a stable economy but keeping to two percent is a tricky task and the bank of England aren't in control of all

KSAT 12,2.0,S1YjuFfCqvU,with inflation at a 41-year high Rising costs are on everyone's mind it's really hard to get some of those basic necessities without stretching the budget to fight inflation the Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates but that also affects you generally making it more expensive if you're trying to get a new mortgage or car loan so if you can wait another six to eight months then I would definitely hold off on buying that car or buying that house those prices are going to have to come down too so that'll be a benefit it also affects existing debt if you have a variable rate like many credit cards you really need to to try to get fixed grades or get rid of some of those credit cards to begin with a possible Silver Lining to the higher interest rates is it could also mean higher yields for savings later on the banks are not anxious to raise those interest rates but eventually they'll have to to stay competitive we have all these different institutions so you got to look and say what are they paying and what's my minimum requirement and can I afford it and not touch it as both economists we talked with think we're already in our recession so far at least it's it's very mild saving it's a good idea at the moment in the environment that's emerging now it's better to be a saver than than a spender or or a debtor Garrett Berger KSAT 12 news
KSAT 12,2.0,LJS3xyTcU7k,[Music] you've read the headlines for months the u.s dealing with the highest inflation we've seen in decades the things you routinely bought a year ago costing you nearly 10 percent more today but why is that what's driving the current inflation rate and is there any clearer sign of where the economy is headed that's what we're breaking down in this case that explains the short answer is inflation is rising prices what's dragging on forever is the way it feels it's not a one-month flip in prices but a continual increase in prices cereal is 13 more expensive compared to last year eggs up nearly 11 just about everything costs more basically it's it's increases in in prices of the things that we tend to buy most often so what got us here answering that means we have to go back here to the moments in march of 2020 we won't forget we are now in a state of emergency on the national the state and city level here in san antonio tonight we're announcing our stay-at-home emergency declarations with everyone stuck at home cash flow across the country was down we weren't spending like we used to so the federal government tried to stimulate the economy by sending out stimulus checks to americans three rounds of checks between march of 2020 and march of 2021. each of those stimulus rounds also came with hundreds of dollars given per child it helped some people cover lost wages because of the pandemic or pay for things they couldn't afford otherwise then came the third round of stimulus money in march 2021 fourteen hundred dollar checks that time the stimulus package that came out of 1.9 trillion that congress passed was too big and how it was basically paid for was by printing money problem was was our economic output shortfall by the time they pass the 1.9 trillion was about half a trillion so we're short half a trillion but then you spend 1.9 trillion that's too big of spending think of the u.s economy like a fish tank the water represents money and during the pandemic the water or money got too low because nobody was spending so the government added more by sending out those checks but if you add too much water a tank will overflow and if you print too much money you get inflation cash flow is only part of this equation something else wasn't flowing because of the pandemic either stuff a lot of it's supply chain related the fact that the uh port of uh ports in particular the ports of los angeles and long beach where most of the containers come into the us 40 of the goods imported by the u.s come in through those two ports and with covid they've had trouble keeping staffing levels up keeping the goods flowing hard time getting chips for cars computers etc so there was more money in the economy but fewer things to spend it on so prices on what was available went up and then so did oil prices russia invaded ukraine in february 2022 that had an impact on the global oil market as countries trying to hit russia where it hurts because of u.s sanctions or i should say generally nato sanctions that there's a desire to to punish the russians for their invasion of ukraine it's not clear how effective some of those sanctions are what is clear is the combined punch to your paycheck the u.s inflation rate is at eight and a half percent right now according to the consumer price index that's a record kept by the government to show how prices on things you pay for are changing so crude oil or raw steel or commercial real estate none of those things are in the cpi but gasoline bananas your rent that you pay all those things are every month the consumer price index looks at 60 to 80 000 prices on a range of items from 75 different locations all across the country you know that gives us this big pile of prices and then we take that big pile of prices and sort of compare it to the previous pilot prices and see how much they've gone up take a gallon of whole milk the consumer price index says we were paying around three dollars 25 cents for that in july 2020 363 in july 2021 and 4 15 this july the consumer price index is published monthly but it's not just used to help you understand what's costing more it's also a factor in business decisions maybe landlords or who are using it to raise their rent or bosses who are using it to give their employees raises or people in the financial world who are interested in what's happening with inflation and social security recipients get a cost of living adjustment every year based on the cpi but the current inflation rate is one the u.s hasn't seen in 40 years so that's the problem and the federal reserve has taken steps to try to fix it by raising interest rates this summer the fed has done it twice each time raising it by three quarters of a percent now to a range of 2.25 to two and a half percent it's an effort to try to discourage people from borrowing and spending money the belief is that the economy is running too hot that there's too much demand and we need to sort of quell that demand and rising interest rates will do that but it could take a while to see progress it's not like instantaneously when the federal reserve raises interest rates immediately the economy slows down it's like driving a super tanker right it takes time to make a turn to the left or the right it'll happen or just happen with the delay the bigger question may not be when but if if the u.s economy will avoid recession the track record of trying to avoid recessions by the federal reserve when they're trying to reduce inflation is not good the so-called soft landing where you reduce inflation without causing a recession is a rare event it's often a hard landing where you get a recession the odds are soon we will be in a recession but san antonio may have something working in its favor a local economy that's not what it used to be all that to say that san antonio its economy uh is much more than military city usa or you know a tourism destination san antonio is much more than that now there's aerospace there's uh healthcare medical a whole host of financial services a whole host of other industries that sort of uh uh buffer the economy you can buffer the economy somewhat in a recession [Applause] and then just last week the head of the federal reserve said it is likely we'll see another increase in interest rates this year as the fed keeps on trying to push down inflation ksat explains takes one topic every single week and gives you more context and perspective you can scan this qr code to see this story or any case that explains we've

Bloomberg News,2.0,NBC News,can bitcoin save you from inflation bitcoins fans love the idea of using cryptocurrency as a hedge against hyperinflation in fact the original white paper which serves as the founding document for the whole asset class specifically talks of a phase when no coins will be created and it will become inflation free but is this really possible can bitcoin truly abolish the cycles of hyperinflation in human history that seem money returned to the value of the paper they printed on in places as diverse as germany zimbabwe and russia will it protect you if the price of bread is paid in a wheelbarrow full of banknotes so far the evidence is contradictory on the one hand bitcoin's price has almost no correlation with the market-based measures of inflation expectations for instance while gold a known inflation hedge has a near perfect relationship with u.s bonds to track inflation bitcoin does not and while gold still buys the same amount of stuff as it did in the days of ancient rulers of babylon bitcoin has only been around for little over a decade on the other hand for the brief period that bitcoin has existed its purchasing power certainly has risen yes there were periods of spectacular crashes where its value measured in u.s dollars collapsed but over time those who held on to the cryptocurrency rather than actively trading it were able to buy more and more with it in 2013 one bitcoin bought about half a barrel of oil in 2017 it bought 300. last year you could get more than a thousand barrels for a single bitcoin now economists might warn that at a macro level that's deflationary and counterproductive for investment and growth but for those hoarding bitcoin it was obviously a great result the jury is still out on whether this will remain true in the long run but until now at least bitcoin has proven a great store of wealth even as it failed to purely hedge inflation i'm eddie van der waals this is decrypted for more content like this follow us on your favorite platforms
moneycontrol,2.0,47WQ8n6KPJU,i'm sure you've come across a barrage of articles and news reports about inflation in the last couple of months ever wondered what lies beneath the headlines on growth or inflation numbers and the jargon associated with the two most important macroeconomic indicators then this ready reckoner is all you need the world is stumbling from one economic crisis to another one is caused by a pandemic and the other by a military invasion the impact of these events have been fully reflected in two key indicators growth and inflation so what do these words mean if such questions leave you scratching your head keep watching this video as we've put together 10 terms that are key to understand the economic turmoil prevailing in india and the world number one annualized inflation it's the percentage change in prices for a period compared to the same period of the previous year it's calculated by comparing the respective index numbers whether the consumer price index or the wholesale price index for the two periods india's inflation target along that of other countries is spelt out in these terms next up is core inflation which measures inflation after excluding items whose prices are volatile food and fuel for instance this measure of inflation is more stable than the headline number and is seen as an indicator of the underlying demand number three is depression a fallen gdp for multiple years is termed a depression a recession is commonly defined as at least two consecutive quarters of year-on-year contraction in gdp such as the one india experience in the second and third quarters of 2020 following a nationwide lockdown next we have the k-shaped recovery this is what economists say india is currently experiencing with different sections of the economy recovering at varying rates for instance the rich may have become richer following the pandemic as they could easily work from home meanwhile the poor may have been rendered unemployed by the pandemic depending on the nature of their jobs and then there's the v-shaped recovery and as the name suggests it represents a near instantaneous recovery from a rapid decline it was thought india's recovery from the pandemic would be v-shaped but instead it has been k-shaped moving on monetary policy report is a report the rbi is legally mandated to release every six months published in april and in late september or early october every year it gives details about the sources of inflation and inflation forecasts for the next 6 to 18 months now coming on to stagflation which is a combination of stagnation and inflation it refers to a period of low growth and high inflation a classic example of stagflation is the 1970s the world bank has drawn comparisons between the current situation and the 1970s citing the prolonged period of highly accommodative monetary policy in major advanced economies followed by persistent supply-side disturbances pushing inflation higher and now coming to shrink flation stringflation refers to the phenomenon of companies maintaining the price of their goods but reducing the quantity offered let's say a packet of chips continues to cost 20 rupees but now weighs 52 grams instead of 60 grams earlier companies do this to avoid raising their prices which maybe can demand further and lead to a loss of market share this usually occurs when rising input costs put pressure on companies margins next is liquidity surplus or deficit which indicates the level of money available in the banking system during an economic crisis central banks provide extra liquidity as the rbi and other central banks did during the pandemic however excess liquidity can lead to higher inflation as greater sums of money chase the same number of goods and finally you have terminal rate it's the level of policy rate consistent with stable inflation and full capacity utilization this level of policy rate is not fixed and can vary over time economists say the terminal repo rate for india may be six to six and a half percent currently suggesting a series of rate hikes in the coming months hope this video was helpful guys don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music]
NBC News,2.0,dGAFh0dCeDE,so Vicki today marks one year since President Biden signed the inflation reduction act the controversial legislation has been praised by democrats for its investment in climate issues and criticized by Republicans for raising taxes but surveys suggests most Americans don't really know what all is in it lucky for us our Noah pransky is here to explain it hey Noah hey there so what isn't it the things in it you got climate Investments Health Care reforms corporate tax reforms on their own all of these are individually popular and as the legislation turns one today the president wants you to know who is responsible we've heard lots of debate about the inflation reduction act the most important investment that we've ever made in our energy security the biggest tax hike the history of our country but do you really know what's in it let's break it down the inflation reduction act also known as the IRA committed a half trillion dollars over the next 10 years toward clean energy and Health Care Investments we're talking about tax credits for electric vehicles for improving your home energy consumption and for companies that produce renewable energy also insulin price caps prescription drug reform and Affordable Care Act subsidies to pay for it the IRA also included increased IRS enforcement and a 15 corporate minimum tax the Congressional budget office found the bill would more than pay for itself and in the year since it was signed inflation has pretty much done what the president promised it would this bill will in fact reduce inflationary pressure on the economy we're back close once again to the fed's two percent inflation Target but economists have been skeptical about attributing any drop in our inflation rate to the inflation reduction act in fact not even President Biden appears to be making that claim anymore at a recent fundraiser he said quote I wish I hadn't called it the inflation reduction act because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing Alternatives that generate economic growth wind energy is cheaper than fossil fuels salt orange is cheaper regardless only one in four Americans say today that they have a good idea of what's in the bill and Yale researchers found that only 38 of America approves of it however when that same group of respondents was briefed on the contents of the bill their support nearly doubled to 68 the provisions are popular in the rare cases where Americans are actually familiar with them which may explain the president's recent interest in barnstorming the country folks every Republican voted against our clean energy investment known as inflation reduction eager to talk all things IRA I mean let's talk about branding honestly at the end of the day the name of it didn't work Biden doesn't even like the name of it now but and you've mentioned that really interesting survey that found what 68 of people approved of what was actually in once they learned what's in it right well what about lawmakers this is crazy to me the reaction across party lines did people not know what they were voting for uh well I think lawmakers had an idea but again branding right so it's part of the Republican brand to oppose anything that the Biden Administration does it's part of their Democratic brand but nobody's really selling what's in it and just to prove your point uh this Yale study which showed huge shifts in favorability they mentioned the word investment and not spending that's where we saw the popularity almost double so again depending what you call it spending investment makes a big difference absolutely words matter words matter energy interesting as always thank you for breaking that down thanks for watching our YouTube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the NBC News app
The Economist,2.0,dgmDcK5wssU,[Music] consumer prices are up interest rates are rising after about a generation global inflation is surging again why have millions of people around the world become exposed to high inflation and what can we do to bring it back under control henry i'm going to start with you what is inflation inflation is a rise in prices uh it's a rise in average prices measured by a basket of goods and services typically it's when everything gets expensive and when you think about that it's important to realize it's not when just one thing gets more expensive that's what we call a change in relative prices it's a change in overall prices why do economists get so exercised about it what happens if we just let inflation kind of do its thing why do we care so if inflation starts creeping up and i think that that's going to last then i might start pushing up you know the wage increase that i would like or the um prices that i would like to set and so what you have what you end up having is a situation where prices start creeping up higher and higher and higher and we know from places where inflation is really high that that has a cost my own view is that it's really more like an on off switch either inflation is low enough that people don't really have to worry about it too much or it's high enough that they pay a lot of attention because they're feeling it every time they buy anything and they have to budget more carefully and all the things that are going on right now and then it really shoots up the scales in terms of its political importance what are the levers that policymakers have to make inflation go up or down well there's been a consensus for about three decades or so that the primary responsibility for controlling inflation is the responsibility of the central bank and that the way in which you control inflation is by raising interest rates when inflation's too high which reduces the amount of spending in the economy reduces the amount of money chasing a limited pool of goods and services which is ultimately what causes people to put their prices up at the moment with inflation too high the real question is how high are central banks going to raise interest rates in order to fight it the next section we're going to is what we're going to do about inflation now um obviously at the moment central banks are raising rates pretty rapidly is this going to cause inflation to come down fairly quickly as the central banks hope i mean that's the question of the day really is how effective central banks are going to be in bringing down inflation the pace of the monetary tightening is pretty steep it's the steepest in america since the early 1980s um so after a period of hesitation it looks like they're taking the problem seriously um the real question now is how much pain that's going to cause i think there's a sort of dirty little secret of monetary economics and that's that the actual mechanisms by which higher interest rates flow through the economy aren't that well understood it wouldn't surprise me if they still have to go significantly higher but i have complete faith in the ability of higher interest rates to bring down inflation ultimately because if you raise rates high enough it will it will as ratchet said cause a cause a recession eventually and that's very effective at bringing inflation down if you're a policy maker now like what else are you or should you be thinking about doing to get inflation expectations down to the extent that inflation is about the balance between demand and supply in the economy you know other policies that reduce aggregate demand would bring inflation down as well and their you know tighter fiscal policy raising taxes reducing spending would bring down prices as well what we're being reminded of right now is just how unpopular inflation is how much people dislike um you know prices pump going up um the feeling that when they go to supermarkets they can afford less and less you know and and that has political consequences and can drive politicians and governments to try to do things to rein in price rises the proof is in the pudding central banks have to deliver the low inflation and then people will believe that inflation is going to be low thanks for watching to read the economist coverage of inflation click on the link and don't forget to subscribe
MSNBC,2.0,UbAKuCp8y98,on this vote the yeas are 220 the nays are 207 the resolution the motion is adopted [Applause] the inflation reduction act officially passed in congress today the sweeping tax climate and health bill will land on president biden's desk next week and not a single republican voted for it back with us tonight to discuss all of it california congresswoman katie porter katie i heard you might even have a white board with you which is really your signature move and i'm excited about it inflation reduction act great name now for all of those who say president biden what are you going to do about inflation you've got it explain to us how it's going to help the american people well the thrust of the bill is bringing down costs and for american families in the short term through things like reducing the health care premiums that families pay within the affordable care act reducing the price of prescription drugs and reducing energy costs for families in terms of heating and cooling their homes so those are the three areas that families are going to see immediate investments but the other part about this is about creating a kind of strong stable globally competitive economy that's going to have the kind of energy independence and energy security that will help us fight forces like global instability that can lead to inflation in the future so i think there's this is a a terrific economic plan and then it both addresses short-term um concerns where are american families right now but also as a mom as someone who's thinking about the future this sets us up to equal and best our global competitors in terms of the economy of tomorrow there are some republicans out there warning with the passage of this bill there will be quote an army of 87 000 irs agents coming for americans earning less than 75 000 a year you want a fact check what what a load of malarkey that is just not true let me tell you the straight deal i get phone calls every day from my constituents and my colleagues around the country i'm asking for help with federal agencies that are not being responsive that they're waiting on answers from the number one agency that the american people would like to have have more agents be more helpful pick up the phone build better technology be more responsive is the irs so this is an investment in allowing the irs to modernize and prepare for the wave of anticipated retirements in customer service agents that we're already facing the audit piece of this is focused on big corporations and that's exactly why you're hearing republicans who are beholden to those big corporations try to weaken and attack this piece the reality is the focus of the bill on the audit piece is on big corporations it's on cracking down on corporate tax cheats and here's how that math works for every dollar that we invest in irs enforcement of the most wealthy americans and the largest corporations with an army of lawyers and accountants to do their bidding we can recover five dollars in taxes that are owed to the rest of us and ultimately this kind of investment is going to let us have a more stable tax structure going forward could you have that white board you can wipe it off because i want you to fill it out for me again the next time you're here and explain to me how come private equity firms are still allowed to cheat this system but we will save that for another day i want to take the time i have left to ask you what this bill is going to do to address climate change absolutely this bill makes a historically important investment in green energy and what this is going to do is allow the american economy to best our competitors at winning the green manufacturing jobs of the future the country that is able to dominate on the world stage for the next 10 50 years is going to be the country that figures out how to do that in a way that is not dependent on fossil fuel prices not dependent on petrol dictators not creating pollution that has to be cleaned up it's the company it's the country that's going to do it in a green way and so this makes a 50 billion dollar investment in technologies like wind and solar that are going to help us do that manufacturing without the cost and the burden of the pollution that we've seen in some traditional manufacturing so for me this is about creating good high paying jobs and creating the foundation for more high-paying jobs in the future all right then congressman katie porter always good to see you especially when you are celebrating on a friday night thanks for coming thank you [Music] you
