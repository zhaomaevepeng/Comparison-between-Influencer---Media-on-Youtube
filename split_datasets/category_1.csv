Johnny Harris,1.0,zIbNJCSCEjk,"(electronic music) - No, no cool intro, no fancy music. I just want to explain inflation in six minutes. I have a degree in economics. I spent years trying to understand this. (ominous music) so let's see if I can boil it down. What is inflation? Why is it rising? Why are people worried? And what do interest rates have to do with it? - The Federal Reserve is raising the interest rate. - [Reporter] Fed is set to raise interest rate. - Highest inflation in 40 years. - Listen, I know that I make long videos. I'm into nuance, I'm into backstory. Well, this isn't that. This is quick. (""quick"" echoing) No, really, this is quick. Let's go. - Okay, first up, the simplest definition. Inflation is when there is more money in the economy than stuff to spend it on. But if you're like me, the simplest definition never does it for you. So let's try this. Imagine a village that has one market where people buy all of their stuff, their food, their clothes, but one day the government shows up because they're worried about the economy of this village. So they tell the people that if they want to take out a loan, they're gonna make sure that the banks will not charge them a high interest rate. They want to encourage the people to take out loans and spend money. Oh, and they also drop off a giant pile of cash for everyone in the village. And everyone in the village is like, ""Sweet, I'm feeling pretty rich."" Villagers now are going to their market and they're buying way more stuff. Many of them have been eyeing the fancy electric bike in the market that before they couldn't justify. But now they totally can because they have all this new money. The store owner's like, ""Sweet. this is great for business."" But he's running out of bikes. In fact, he's running out of everything because now all of these people have extra money and they're buying way more than they used to. The store owner is like, ""I can't keep up with all this demand, I should raise prices."" And that is inflation. But the village is all of us and the market is the entire economy. When there's extra money floating around and people wanna spend it faster than businesses can make stuff, then all of the businesses in all of the industries raise their prices. And that is inflation. It's a natural part of the economy. It's kind of a good thing in small doses because it means that the economy is growing. And it's why movie tickets used to be 25 cents and now they're like $15. And slowly over time, it's fine. Okay, let's go back to the village and see what happens if we keep going at this rate. The store owner has now doubled his prices on bikes. The interest rate is super low so he takes out a loan to build a new factory to make bikes. This is good, he's growing a business. But the government money eventually runs out and his prices are still double. But now the store owner has no one to come buy all of his new bikes. And now he has this factory and more employees, but no customers. He has to shut down the factory, lay off everyone, and slowly start lowering his prices. This is called recession. When COVID shut down the world, governments gave us money, free money. They're like don't panic and hoard all your money, instead spend and borrow and keep the economy going. Here in the U.S., they literally sent us $3,200 checks. They gave 600 bucks a week to people who were unemployed for months and months and months. They gave subsidies to people with kids. They increased spending on food stamps. I mean, trillions and trillions of dollars of stimulus money. This was vital aid to people in need, but even people who didn't lose a job got a check in the mail. It was free money for everyone and we spent it. - I just picked up myself a new bike. - [Reporter] Demand is up across the country. - It's time to grind, Peloton. - We all just got these big checks from the government during a pandemic. We're like YOLO, I'm buying a boat or a Peloton or whatever. - [Man] Pokemon cards. - [Man] There's Netflix. - [Woman] Fortnite. - [Man] A new Motor. - [Woman] Peloton. - [Woman] Good soak in a hot tub. - [Woman] Animal Crossing. - Push it out a little bit so it-- - No, don't you dare! - But pair all this new spending with the fact that the pandemic also made it harder for factories and ships and retailers to get us all this stuff. - Supply chain issue. - Global supply chain. - Supply chain. - Supply. - Chain. - So now you have an economy where people have way more money than normal and they're ready to spend it, but the economy can't get them stuff fast enough. So what do businesses do with all this insane new demand? They raise prices all at the same time and that is inflation. (exhaling) I feel like we're getting this at this point. But what do interest rates have to do with all this? - Raising the interest rate. - Interest rate. - Or the Fed? - Fed. - Federal Reserve. - The Federal Reserve. - Most countries have a central bank, the puppet master of the economy, the bank of all banks for that country. But it's not like a normal bank that stores our money and then lends it out and collects interest to make profit. That's what a normal private bank does. The central bank, which we call the Fed here in the U.S. is run by the government. So their job is to set the rules or policies that all the other banks have to follow. And the central bank isn't motivated by profit, but rather their job is to babysit the economy to keep it growing, to make sure people have jobs, to make sure that prices don't fluctuate too much so that we can keep growing nicely, no slow down, no recession, that is what the Fed is there for. But seriously, the Fed is like a puppet master and we are the puppets and it's kind of creepy. They pull strings in the economy to get us to spend our money in a certain way, which in turn affects how much businesses raise or drop their prices. And guess what? It totally works. One of the strings that they have to pull in the economy is called the interest rate. Wanna borrow money to buy a car or a house or expand your business? You're gonna be way more likely to do that if you only have to pay 2% interest on that loan as opposed to like 6%. Lower interest rates equal people and businesses wanna borrow and spend money. So during the pandemic, the central bank was like we need everyone to spend money. So they lowered the interest rate and people borrowed and people spent, and it totally worked. We're like freaking puppets. So a lower interest rate helped stimulate the economy. But once again, we're in this same place where there's now too much money to borrow and spend and not enough goods and services to spend it on. So what do businesses do all at the same time? They raise prices to meet all this new demand all at the same time and now your money is worth less. And that is inflation. - [Reporter] Home prices rising at their highest rate. - [Man] Astronomical bidding war. - Are going up. - By nearly 24%. - So that's what's happening right now. All the prices are rising kind of at the same time. What that means is that your hundred dollar bill is now worth 8% less than it was last year. Like the same money is worth less because your purchasing power just got diluted. And imagine if that keeps happening? Like instead of 8% it's 50%? Now your hundred dollar bill is worth what $50 used to be. And that's when people start to freak out. And our economy that's built on human psychology starts to falter and we fall into a recession or a depression, even, if it gets real bad, which is exactly what the Fed is built to avoid. So they're back to pulling their strings and they've started raising rates. - The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. - The Federal Reserve taking action to try and curb rising inflation. - They're gently raising the interest rate to cool down all of this hardcore spending and borrowing, see if they can steer the ship back on course. And let's hope it works. Okay, did we do it? Did we do, did we do it in the time period that I promised I would? - [Nick] I have no idea. - We'll find out. (jazz music) Okay, last thing I wanna say is a thing that didn't make it into my little inflation explainer, but a few years ago when I worked at Vox, I went to Venezuela and Columbia to do a borders series. I saw inflation up close and personal because in Venezuela, inflation got so out of control and they couldn't, the Fed, the puppet master couldn't figure out how to get it back in control that their money became worth nothing. The prices went up so high that their money became basically worthless. You needed like a pile of cash to buy bread. So what they started doing is they started using the currency itself to make things. I visited this guy on the street who was making purses and bags and sculptures out of cash because it was worth more as a raw material than it was as money, as a currency, which is insane. That's a very extreme version of inflation. It's happened in several countries that have done this. We're not in that situation, even close to that situation, but it's an example of just how tenuous modern economies are. They're not pegged to gold or whatever. They're pegged to a bunch of humans believing that this stuff is worth something and it can quickly go off the rails. So I thought I'd share that little, fun thing that is more documented in the Vox borders episode that you can go watch on the Vox YouTube channel. So that's all I've got. Thank you all for being here and I think you should check out, if you want to color your videos or your photos, I have LUTs and presets that you can use to color correct your stuff. I also have a storytelling course on Bright Trip where I talk about my methodology for visual storytelling with Nathaniel Drew. I think that's sort of it, all the plugs I should do at the end of these videos, but yeah, lots more to come. We're working on lots of amazing videos and I'm really excited to share them. So I'll see you in the next one. Bye, everyone. Okay."
KINGCADEMY,1.0,nKTwz9mdsFw,hey everyone kieran king here today i'm going to be talking about the inverse relationship between inflation and interest rates inflation seems to be a hot topic with many nations seeing greater inflation than usual why well the main reason is of course due to the global pandemic over the last two years and the subsequent supply chain problems that have arisen causing a spike in demand and price increases everywhere to fight rapid inflation certain governments around the world have increased interest rates for instance the bank of england in the uk increased interest rates only recently from 0.1 to 0.25 but what is the theory behind this this is what we're going to look at in this video firstly what is inflation inflation generally speaking is the weakening of a currency and the subsequent increase in the prices of everyday goods and services for instance the price of bread in the uk in 1975 was 16p in 2021 it is around 106 p as prices rise this means that the currency's purchasing power decreases using the same example 160 nowadays could buy you six and a half loaves of bread back in 1975. the rate of inflation can be measured using something called a consumer price index or cpi which i have done in a separate video on if you're interested now typically you don't want inflation to be too high as it will be difficult for businesses to set the right prices for their products and for people to plan their spending on the other hand if it is too low then people might not spend as much as they expect prices to fall which stops the economy growing let's move on to interest rates what are interest rates interest rates tell you what the cost of borrowing is or what the rewards are for saving if you get a loan for say a thousand pound from the bank at a one percent interest rate it means the total amount you're gonna have to repay is one thousand and ten pounds an extra one percent on top of what you borrowed on the flip side if you put a thousand pound away to save a one percent interest rate it means you will earn ten pound after a year so will have with one thousand and ten pounds when we talk about interest rates in the news this usually means the base rate which the bank of england over here in the uk sets this has a heavy influence on the rates you get from high street banks and other institutions to borrow and save so back to the initial question how does inflation and interest rates work together well what is the relationship between them let's give an example say interest rates are lower than usual this encourages people to borrow more and save less as rates are low it is cheap to borrow but less rewarding to save as a result what do people do people they tend to spend more when interest rates are low they consume more they go out for dinner they buy cars on finance they have holidays and so on in the big picture there is a greater demand for goods and services so the demand becomes stronger when compared to the supply greater demand to supply of these goods and services means those goods and services can afford to increase their prices and an increase in prices as you know increase the rate of inflation let's now let's look at the opposite what if there are higher interest rates than usual well the opposite happens higher rates encourage people to save more and borrow less it is expensive to borrow but rewarding to save and put money away as a result that's what people do they don't go out as much they don't have lots of holidays and instead put their money away for a rainy day this initiates lesser demand to supply of general goods and services this means that those goods and services need to decrease their prices leading to decreased inflation or perhaps even deflation now this is just the theory and there are a lot of things that influence the inflation rate and not just the current interest rate looking back over history however we do tend to see this relationship justified anyway do you think it's justified let me know in the comments as always thank you for your continued support if you do like my content then please hit the subscribe button and give me a like also if you have any ideas for other videos then feel free to message me and i'll try and add them to the list take care everyone and i'll see you all soon [Music]
Professor Dave Explains,1.0,867AUDQ9DQc,"Have you ever talked to your parents or grandparents about what prices used to be when they were kids? If so, they probably told you about how milk and candy and hot dogs used to be much cheaper, and it’s true. Over long periods of time, most things do tend to get more and more expensive. This is due to something called inflation. Let’s look at an example. Jane and Bob bought their house in 1970 for $15,000 and have lived in it ever since. However, now that they are finally looking to retire and downsize, they find that their home is now worth $150,000. The reason for this isn’t just supply and demand. It’s inflation. Inflation is simply a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money. We’re not talking about the prices of specific items here. We’re talking about prices going up for almost every commonly purchased item. When inflation is rapid and dramatic, that is generally unsustainable and leads to an economic crisis. Such an event is called hyperinflation. Essentially, hyperinflation is inflation that’s going out of control. One negative consequence of inflation is a drop in purchasing power. Purchasing power is the amount of stuff you can purchase with a unit of currency. As prices go up, the purchasing power of money goes down. If you were hoping to follow the lead of Jane and Bob, try buying a house today for $15,000. It’s quite unlikely that you’ll be able to find anything at that price point. So how do we know that prices are going up across the board? Well, thankfully economists have come up with things called price indexes, which are measurements that show how the average price of a standard group of goods changes over time. In the United States, the best known of these is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The CPI is determined by measuring the price of a standard group of goods and services meant to represent a “market basket” of stuff typically bought by your average urban consumer. Here are the eight categories of goods and services that CPI currently looks at, with examples of each listed. Keep in mind that every 10 years these categories are updated to adjust for changes in spending habits. American economists use the CPI to calculate the inflation rate, which is the percentage rate of change in price level over time. Although they can calculate this between any two points in time, typically it is done from one year to the next. Generally, we want at least a little bit of inflation. In fact, an inflation rate of around 2-3% is considered a good thing in order to promote investment and economic growth. People are more likely to invest capital if they know that prices are likely to go up from year to year. So what causes inflation? Well, economists debate about which cause is the most significant, but they generally agree on three main causes. First, the quantity theory of inflation states that too much currency available can cause prices to go up and purchasing power to go down. This makes sense if you think about it. If a government just creates money out of thin air, there is a certain point where it won’t be worth anything anymore. We’ve seen this precise thing happen quite recently in places like Bolivia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. In fact, at one point Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation was so bad due to over printing of their currency that at its worst between 2007 and 2008, its inflation rate was 89.7 sextillion percent. If you’re wondering how big that number is, this is what it looks like: 89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%. The second cause of inflation is an increase in aggregate demand, or the total demand for all finished goods and services in an economy. This usually happens due to higher income. If more and more people can afford to buy stuff, they will, and the result is an increase in prices across the board. The third cause of inflation is when producers have to spend more money in order to produce. For example, if producers have to pay their workers higher wages, they might raise their prices to adjust for a potential loss in profit. Inflation is most concerning for those on a fixed income, or an income that does not increase even when prices consistently go up. One example of this is those who get government assistance, such as Social Security payments. Governments can be slow to adjust payments to keep up with inflation. The opposite of inflation is deflation, which is a reduction of the overall level of prices in an economy. Economists generally view deflation as a negative thing since producers respond to falling prices by slowing down their production, which leads to layoffs and salary reductions, ultimately causing the economy to stop growing. So that covers the concept of inflation and deflation, as well as their causes. We must understand that inflation is more or less inevitable. We cannot escape rising prices. And in fact, we do want at least some inflation, because as long as we are able to adapt to it, it’s better for the economy in the long run. So let’s move forward and learn about some other concepts in economics."
The Local Investor,1.0,xzNkKONrwRU,inflation is the most destructive disease known to Modern societies there is nothing which will destroy a society so thoroughly and so fully as letting inflation run right inflation doesn't arise because you got consumers who are spend Thrift they've always been spend Thrift it doesn't arise because you've got a businessmen who are greedy they've always been greedy inflation arises because we as citizens have been asking you as politicians to perform an impossible task we've been asking you to spend somebody else's money on us but not to spend our money on anybody else Everybody Talks against inflation but what he means is that he wants the prices of the things he sells to go up and the prices of the things he buys to go down the real tax on the American people is not what you label taxes it's total spending if Congress spends $50 billion more than it takes in if Government spends $50 billion who do you suppose pay that $50 billion the Arab sheiks aren't paying it Santa Claus isn't paying it the Tooth Fairy isn't paying it you and I as taxpayers are paying it indirectly through hidden taxation
Ben Shapiro,1.0,KZJm-Bt4rSs,so right now if you got bruce bruce is a guy who wears sunglasses that's just who he is man okay have you got bruce over there right now he is freaking out about inflation because his wallet is empty and so bruce is going to be living a life with his hands up to the sky wondering what the heck happened and that is exactly why bruce is saying let's go brandon alrighty folks today we are going to explain why inflation is out of control here in the united states we're going to break it down along three axes we're going to talk about supply chain problems we're going to talk about government spending and we're going to talk about monetary inflation via the federal reserve this video is brought to you by our friends over at birch gold by the way this video is a pretty good reason why you might want to invest at least a little bit into precious metals okay so why don't we begin with joe biden's big excuse that is the supply chain when the pandemic happened factories everywhere shut down it is much easier to shut down a factory as it turns out than to spin it back up and the supply chains across the world are extraordinarily integrated in a way that they weren't for most of human history so for example according to some surveys in 2019 nearly 100 of major companies said that they had some part of their supply chain located in china well china had all of these jobs shipped over there right all the way over here because they have very few labor regulations because they have slave labor in some cases they have no environmental regulation so if you're going to create dye for example and then just dump the toxic waste into a river you ain't going to do that in europe you're not going to do that in the united states wealthy nations can afford to care about the environment china doesn't care so china just pollutes up the wazoo that means that if you're going to produce a manufactured good then you are generally going to be doing that in china if you're going to be doing innovation if you're going to be doing service industry stuff you're going to be doing that in the west and as the supply chain starts to become longer and longer in order to account for the differences between labor supplies and different countries you start to see massive integration between countries well when something shuts down in china that means that it's going to have an impact on whatever is the next factory that requires the input there's a very famous essay called i pencil came out in 1985 all about how a pencil is created they take the most simple object that you know of and think about how many different countries this thing has had to go through in order to get to you when you have a pencil you have the little eraser where's the rubber come from you have a little metal piece where does that come from you have the wood where is that coming from you have the paint on the outside where's that coming from you got the lead where's that coming from we'll now take complex product like a car and you're talking about maybe half a dozen or a dozen countries that the various parts have to come from in order to manufacture that well you shut down not one factory but many factories all at the same time because of covid it's gonna be very difficult to spin that back up so you're gonna see a real shock in terms of the supply that is available to deal with the demand now when the pandemic hit what people were mostly concerned about is that demand would completely disappear and you get a worldwide depression because people just would not buy anything ever again nobody had a job nobody had any money nobody knew exactly what to do and nothing like this had really happened in modern history before certainly not on a global scale the way that this did and you combine that with the long tail of regulations that have existed in the west with for example the port so in the united states the unions in the united states have bargained particularly on the west coast to shut down the ports for certain numbers of hours per day you have real problems with how containers fit on ships and what sort of containers fit on trucks and what happens if they can't fit into the ports properly and so what you end up with is at every place in the supply chain real delays let's say that you have a factory in china and it is manufacturing a product and it has to make its way around over to india where it's used as an input and now it's going to get shipped to brazil for another input and then that is going to get shipped over to say the east coast of the united states where it then has to travel across the country if at every point here you have a delay you're going to end up with a really really big delay one of the big shortages that's occurred here is in semiconductors because it's difficult to produce semiconductors because the technological innovation that is associated with semiconductors is largely in eastern asia and 92 of all advanced semiconductors are produced in taiwan another six percent are produced over in in south korea and when you have a shortage in semiconductors that means that new cars become incredibly expensive this is why no one can get a new car now this is why used cars are pricing above new cars so the problems of supply chains are very very real and they're not is of course very silly to also pretend as joe biden did that he can just get the ports working 24 hours a day and that fixes it obviously is not going to do it but if this were just a supply chain issue then again it would apply to europe the same as it's applying to the united states and it doesn't which brings us to issue number two how the united states decided to spend during this pandemic and the answer is we spent more money than anyone has ever seen in the history of humanity if you draw a chart of the national debt of the united states here is what it's going to look like okay then 2021 happens the pandemic and our national debt is now off the chart it's gone okay so in the past year and a half we had about seven trillion dollars to the national debt from 2020 to 2021 we added seven trillion dollars to the national debt we spent more money than has ever been seen by god or man the idea was that the federal government was going to pay everybody to stay home they were going to pay them hundreds of dollars per week to stay home that lasted all the way from march 2020 all the way until september of 2021 these extended unemployment benefits for example what did this do they told people why don't you stay home people did people who were working took the money and they pocketed it by the end of the pandemic people had more money in the bank more wealth in the bank than they had at the beginning of the pandemic while many of them were not working we also suspended mortgages we suspended rents we did all of these things we blew out the spending in extraordinary extraordinary ways we did all of this while producing no product so we just it was helicopter money we just dropped money on millions and hundreds of millions of people while simultaneously putting small businesses out of business by telling people they couldn't go to a restaurant they couldn't go to a small mom-and-pop store you could go to a big chain store because after all you had to shop but you couldn't go to like a small mom and pop store so all those places went out of business but here's a check to compensate you for your trouble so what are you doing that's much more money chasing much less product what does that do that creates inflation so that's factor number two which is how much money the government spent this also means that if bruce is looking at future inflation and bruce is also looking for maybe just a little bit of that hard asset that has never been worth zero gold from our good friends over at birch one way that people have historically protected against the predations of the market and inflation has been precious metals 40 years ago ronald reagan saw massive inflation unlike anything the country had seen before that's super high inflation we're talking like 10 15 20 inflation and um and now uh oh in reagan's own words inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber as deadly as a hitman right now your retirement accounts are under attack thanks to the inflationary policies of this administration so if you haven't yet called birch gold i'm asking you why not those are the people i trust to help you diversify your 401k and ira into gold birch gold

brand new book the authoritarian moment text ben 98 98.98 to get your free information kit right now next and finally we get to the activity of the federal reserve under jerome powell and company so these big boys come in and they decide you know what we need to not only temporarily backstop the economy we need to just superheat superheat the economy so you understand at the very beginning that the federal reserve which had not experienced as we say serious inflation in the united states for 40 years for 40 years the idea of inflation had become sort of a thing of the past so much so that there were people on the left who were suggesting that there was something called modern monetary theory you could literally spend as much money as you could possibly want and it would do no damage you would not get major inflation you would never have to pay it off it would be totally fine right this was an actual viable theory like two years ago elizabeth warren was promoting it and now it becomes clear that we've got this over here okay so what did jerome powell do he made a mistake he thought that if there was inflation it would be temporary because after all the demand that he had artificially created would eventually be met by the supply and now that relied on a couple of things one it relied on actual solving of the supply chain problem which we've discussed before but also it relied on the idea that things weren't being overvalued simply by the fact that there was so much money swimming around in the economy okay so the basic idea here is that the lending rate to the banks was was zero right it was free it was free for the federal for the banks to lend each other money and for the banks to to borrow money from the federal all that was zero okay so what that did is it led to an enormous amount of the bank taking out money and then investing in products that they wouldn't normally invest in so for example carnival cruises goes down right six billion dollars or six billion dollars on a stock price because the cruises are going to be shut down for a couple of years instead of carnival going bankrupt basically the federal reserve tells the banks we will back your play so the federal reserve starts buying up assets like never before in human history the federal reserve is currently holding nine trillion dollars in assets nine trillion dollars in assets okay they do this by buying up all sorts of product from the bank and then injecting a bunch of money to the banks which the banks then lend out at very low rates of interest this spurs demand it's first investment it means that you're going to get an inflated stock market bubble you get an inflated real estate bubble but jerome powell kept saying that the inflation was temporary the supply chains would clear up the overspending would would eventually kind of work its way out and the market is sort of like a bump in a snake moving back toward the rear of the snake and eventually everything would clear out well the problem is that the combination of all of these factors buying up nine trillion dollars in assets and sending all this cash into the system which is then being distributed out to a business and being distributed out to a mortgage and being distributed out to an individual right all that money that's out there is then inflating all the pricing so bottom line is what you end up with is is a three-factor disaster area that leads to long-lasting inflation factor number one supply chain factor number two overspending factor number three the fed okay that combo is going to create superheated inflation which is why you see it in the us but you don't really see it as much over in europe so when joe biden says it's just the supply chain that's not correct it's overspending it's the fed it's not just me saying this it's former obama administration under secretary of the treasury stephen ratner okay there are a lot it's larry summers this is not merely a supply chain phenomenon it is also overspending it's also the fed which is why when joe biden says what we really really need to do is spend more money all he's doing is making this worse when he says what if we had the fed continue to set the rates really really low all that is doing is making this worse now to jerome powell's credit and to the credit of the federal reserve they're now trying to bring this down right they're trying to get they're going to try to divest themselves with those nine trillion dollars in assets they're going to raise the overnight interest rates in order to ensure that less money goes into the system they're going to try and suck money out of the system and put those assets back into the system okay all of that is going to lower the phenomenon of monetary inflation there's only one really big problem in the long run supply chains will iron themselves out they will there's one really big problem and that one's this one and the fact is that one ain't going away that's not going away as we suggested when you have 30 trillion dollars in national debt that means the interest payments on the debt are going to comprise an enormous chunk of your budget in future years it means you're gonna have to raise taxes it means you're gonna have to pay people back somehow okay how are you gonna do that the answer is probably economic stagnation that's what i am afraid of i'm not as concerned about inflation being a long lasting phenomenon it'll get cleared up may take a year might take two years but in the end what we did here is we completely reshaped the nature of the economy in the united states we made ourselves way more dependent on the government not only did we make ourselves way more dependent on the government we spent more money has ever been spent in human history we've set a new baseline on what kind of things we will spend money on if that continues you're going to see low growth from here out into the future that's the real danger so as inflation clears up watch for stagnation to set in
Arvin Ash,1.0,q5dy-NtVeF0,"this video is sponsored by one dream stay tuned for a special offer for arvanash viewers you probably know this familiar story in the beginning the universe was packed tightly together into a point of infinite density it then exploded into the universe we see today this is commonly thought of as the big bang astrophysicists will tell you that this image we have of

entire universe itself expanded and became bigger atoms only coalesced a few hundred thousand years later as temperatures cooled and larger structures took much longer to form the big bang was not when the universe had zero size or infinite density it is just a moment in time when the universe was very hot and very dense and the big bang did not happen at some special point in space but everywhere in the known universe at the same time and contrary to popular belief the big bang model is not a theory of how the universe began science doesn't currently tell us how or why the universe came to exist or what caused it to start expanding the big bang model is about events that happened in the early universe which led to the universe we observed today that history is well understood and has been verified by evidence that we can observe even today 13.8 billion years later but up until the 1980s this model failed to explain some other observed properties of the universe which remained puzzles like why is it so homogeneous why its geometry appears flat and why there are no magnetic monopoles along came the theory of cosmic inflation proposed by alan guth and others which solved many of these puzzles and is today considered by most physicists to be a standard part of early big bang cosmology what is this theory of inflation how does it solve some of the most nagging cosmological puzzles and what caused it to happen that's coming up right now today the evidence for the big bang model is so strong that virtually no scientists seriously disputes that it's an accurate description of the history of our observable universe but some observations leading up to the 1970s had found some mysteries that the model in its original form could not account for in order to develop into the universe that we see today the early universe had to have some very specific properties some of which seemed implausible with the early big bang model specifically the questions left unanswered in the model were why was the early universe so uniform why is the universe so close to being geometrically flat and why do we not see any magnetic monopoles which could theoretically exist in 1981 american physicist alan guth wrote a paper in which he proposed the idea of cosmic inflation which could solve these apparent mysteries this is not the kind of inflation that makes your money worth less it means a sudden expansion the simplest version of the theory of inflation says that the universe expanded exponentially fast faster than the speed of light near its earliest history from what is believed to be the beginning of the universe from about 10 to the negative 36 seconds after the big bang to 10 to the negative 32 seconds during this time it expanded a factor of at least 10 to the 78 going from being very small to being exponentially large in comparison you might be thinking i thought things couldn't move faster than the speed of light einstein's theory of special relativity shows that this speed limit applies to things moving within space but not the expansion of space itself so this is permissible note that not all physicists agree that the beginning that is the point when time first started t equals zero is the same as the beginning of the big bang some physicists believe that the big bang happened after inflation around 10 to the negative 12 seconds also note that some descriptions of inflation say something like the universe started out smaller than an atom and then expanded to the size of a grapefruit you should keep in mind that these analogies can be misleading because they imply that the universe has an edge it doesn't there's only the universe and nothing else there is no outside and while we're at it let's dispel some other common misunderstandings about the beginning of the universe the idea that the universe started from a singularity that is a point of infinite density and heat is not correct it's purely due to mathematical extrapolation it's like getting a zero in the denominator of a mathematical equation it is undefined and represents the limit of our knowledge a singularity is probably not a physical thing and is really not what the big bang theory says it is part of the standard model of cosmology basically what the theory says is that the universe today is bigger than it was yesterday and is much bigger than it was a billion years ago so as you extrapolate back the universe gets smaller and smaller denser and denser and hotter and hotter so as you keep going you get to a very small volume of space which is very dense and very hot at some point in this extrapolation our equations stop working because the volume becomes zero but there were probably some other laws of physics that applied at this stage perhaps some kind of quantum gravity that is gravity at infinitesimally small scales we don't have such a theory yet this is something that physicists are feverishly working on along the same lines the universe today is expanding but galaxies aren't actually moving at that expansion rate only the space between galaxies is becoming larger and only on very large scales gravity also plays a role so that on smaller scales gravity still holds stars together within a galaxy and certain nearby galaxies are still attracted to each other like the andromeda galaxy is to our milky way galaxy while the whole universe may come from a tiny volume of space cosmic inflation would have caused all points within that space to expand and this expansion or inflation happened everywhere in space there is no center of the universe or location every point moved away from every other point expansion faster than the speed of light during inflation also means that these points while they may have been causally connected initially would have moved apart after inflation such that they became causally disconnected this is because causality is limited to the speed of light no information can travel faster than the speed as a consequence of this there are certain parts of the universe that we will never be able to see or detect in any way because any light or gravity coming from it will never reach us now let's see how inflation could explain the three problems of the big bang model the observed homogeneity the flatness issue and no observed magnetic monopoles issue when we look out into space we see that the universe on large scales is pretty much uniform the universe is extremely homogeneous and isotropic which is just a physics jargon for saying it appears roughly the same everywhere you look this can also be seen in the cosmic microwave background or cmb where the tiny differences you see on this image represent temperature fluctuations of at most only 0.0001 kelvin or less than one ten thousandth of one degree to see how inflation explains why the early universe was so uniform let's imagine that before inflation the universe was completely random maybe in one place the density was very high and a fraction of a millimeter off to the side the density was very low you can imagine it like the surface of a deflated balloon there may be tiny imperfections like different thicknesses and wrinkles randomly distributed on it now imagine that this balloon is suddenly inflated to a very large size a tiny fraction of a second later the wrinkle in the balloon surface gets smoothed out any density differences of the balloon's skin become diluted this is analogous to what happened during inflation as a tiny volume increased by at least 10 to the 78x now let's look at the flatness problem imagine living like an ant on the surface of a very small balloon it would be a two dimensional world but if the balloon was tiny enough it might be obvious to you that this surface was curved and that you were living in a closed or curved universe however if that ball was expanded to the sides of the earth it would appear flat to you even though it is still a sphere on much larger scales now scale that up to human size and the ball being much larger than even the observable universe to you it would appear to be flat as far as you could see even though it might have been obviously curved to start with inflation stretches any initial curvature of the three-dimensional universe to near flatness we don't know if the universe is 100 flat but if there is curvature it is so small that we can't measure it with our current technology note that when i say curvature it would be an overall curvature of the universe in four dimensions this is not easy to visualize so we have to visualize it as a 3d curvature of a 2d balloons surface a closed curvature for the universe would mean that two parallel lines would eventually converge in our 3d universe just like two parallel lines on the 2d surface of a balloon converge how does inflation solve the monopole problem the fact that we can observe no magnetic monopoles in the universe well monopoles can only theoretically form at very high temperatures the kinds of temperatures that were only present during the big bang but once they formed they should be stable enough to survive the idea is that inflation would have quickly cooled down the universe because of rapid expansion and only monopoles created prior to inflation would then continue to exist in the universe but during inflation the density of monopoles would drop exponentially so their abundance would drop to undetectable levels because they would exist in such low densities imagine that just before inflation there were a thousand monopoles and they were all packed into a cubic meter of space a fraction of a second later those monopoles were spread out in a region 10 to the 78 cubic meters across this would make them so rare that we may never detect them now as the cmb attests the universe is not completely smooth we can see that there are small imperfections small temperature differences this is called the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background you might say well doesn't this ruin the idea of inflation if the universe isn't completely uniform no these small anisotropies are exactly what we would expect inflation only makes the large scales like the cmb look uniform but the small anisotropics can actually explain the origin of the observed structure in the universe prior to inflation the universe we see today was microscopic the quantum fluctuations within the density of matter could have expanded to astronomical scales during inflation and this is what we see across the universe as the higher density regions condensed into stars galaxies and galaxy clusters now the big question you may be asking is how did the universe start what was responsible for inflation this is not well understood it is thought that there may have been a scalar inflation field during the time of the big bang now what is a scalar field as an analogy imagine a room with a fireplace in it every point in that room will have a temperature associated with it so if you were to measure the temperature anywhere in that room it will have some kind of distribution we would be measuring just a magnitude of the temperature this is akin to a scalar field it has only a magnitude now imagine that same room with a giant magnet in the middle of it every point in that room will have a magnetic field which will not only have a magnitude but also a direction in other words if you had a charged particle or small magnet somewhere in that room that object would experience a force that has not only a magnitude but also a different direction depending on its location in the room this is like a vector field it has a magnitude and a direction magnetic fields and gravitational fields are vector fields like this the higgs field and the inflation field are scalar fields analogous to the temperature in the room from a theoretical point of view assuming that an inflation field existed we can show this field with the following diagram in the very early very hot universe the inflation field would have had some value at a point a this would have been the lowest energy density that the field could be in at that high temperature and energies of the universe at that time the theoretical inflatance or particles of the inflation field would have remained at this point however point a would not have been the true vacuum but a false vacuum because as temperatures cooled the field formed a lower energy potential at point c since a was not the lowest point in terms of energy density it is called a false vacuum the natural place for the field to be as the universe cooled and got to lower temperatures and energies was actually c the lowest energy density of the field all natural systems tend towards their lowest energy state so when the inflation field is stuck at a it will tend towards c but before it can get there it has to overcome a small barrier b this can be accomplished with the help of quantum tunneling this can allow the field to overcome the barrier at b and drop down to its lowest energy state at c when the energy difference between point a and point c becomes very large larger than any other energy in the universe inflation starts and when the field reaches the lowest minimum energy density in the potential at point c inflation comes to a stop this is a very short process because as i said earlier inflation lasts only from about 10 to the negative 36 seconds to about 10 to the negative 32 seconds after the beginning so the scalar field causes the almost instantaneous exponential expansion that we call cosmic inflation as this field reaches its lowest potential inflation ends and it decays into other fields and particles after this event the universe continues to expand but in the slower way that the original big bang model described so inflation theory solved several problems in one fell swoop in my next video i'll cover an even more fascinating aspect of inflation and that is the theory of eternal inflation this theory if correct would mean that our universe is but one of a near endless myriad of universes most of which are unimaginably bigger than ours this could also actually explain why our universe is like the way it is so stay tuned for that i'd like to give a big shout out to professor gary felder of smith college who inspired this video he has a

Stay tuned for a special offer for Arvin Ash viewers. You probably know this familiar story: In the beginning, the universe was packed tightly together into a point of infinite density. It then exploded into the universe we see today. This is commonly thought of as the ""Big Bang."" Astrophysicists will tell you that this image we have of the Big Bang model is incorrect. First there was no explosion like a grenade where all kinds of shrapnel goes flying away. There was no substance like stars or galaxies or even atoms that went flying, the entire universe itself expanded and became bigger. Atoms only coalesced a few hundred thousand years later as temperatures cooled. And larger structures took much longer to form. The big bang was not when the universe had zero size or infinite density. It is just a moment in time when the universe was very hot and very dense. And the big bang did not happen at some special point in space, but everywhere in the known universe at the same time. And contrary to popular belief, the big bang model is not a theory of how the universe began. Science doesn’t currently tell us how or why the universe came to exist or what caused it to start expanding. The big bang model is about events that happened in the early universe, which led to the universe we observe today. That history is well understood and has been verified by evidence that we can observe even today, 13.8 billion years later. But, up until the 1980s this model failed to explain some other observed properties of the universe, which remained puzzles, like why it is so homogenous, why its geometry appears flat, and why there are no magnetic monopoles. Along came the theory of cosmic inflation proposed by Alan Guth and others, which solved many of these puzzles, and is today considered by most physicists to be a standard part of early Big Bang cosmology. What is this theory of Inflation? How does it solve some of the most nagging cosmological puzzles? And what caused it to happen? That’s coming up right now… Today, the evidence for the Big Bang model is so strong that virtually no scientist seriously disputes that it’s an accurate description of the history of our observable universe. But some observations leading up to the 1970s had found some mysteries that, the model in its original form, could not account for. In order to develop into the universe that we see today, the early universe had to have some very specific properties, some of which seemed implausible with the early big bang model. Specifically, the questions left unanswered in the model were: Why was the early universe so uniform? Why is the universe so close to being geometrically flat? Why do we not see any magnetic monopoles, which could theoretically exist? In 1981, American physicist, Alan Guth wrote a paper in which he proposed the idea of cosmic inflation which could solve these apparent mysteries. This is not the kind of inflation that makes your money worth less. It means a sudden expansion. The simplest version of the theory of inflation says that the universe expanded exponentially fast, faster than the speed of light, near its earliest history – from what is believed to be the beginning of our universe, from about 10^-36 seconds after the beginning to 10^-32 seconds. During this time, it expanded a factor of at least 10^78, going from being very small to being exponentially large in comparison. You might be thinking, “I thought things couldn’t move faster than the speed of light?” Einstein’s theory of special relativity shows that this speed limit applies to things moving within space, but not the expansion of space itself. So this is permissible. Note that not all physicists agree that the beginning, that is the point when time first started, t=0, is the same as the beginning of the Big Bang. Some physicists believe that the big bang happened after inflation around 10^-12 seconds. Also note that some descriptions of inflation say something like the universe started out smaller than an atom and then expanded to the size of a grapefruit. You should keep in mind that these analogies can be misleading because they imply that the universe has an edge. It doesn’t. There is only the universe and nothing else. There is no outside. While we are at it, let’s dispel some other common misunderstandings about the beginning of the universe. The idea that the universe started from a singularity, that is a point of infinite density and heat, is not correct. It is purely due to mathematical extrapolation. It is like getting a zero in the denominator of a mathematical equation. It is undefined and represents the limit of our knowledge. A singularity is probably not a physical thing, and is really not what the Big Bang theory says. It is part of the standard model of cosmology. Basically, what the theory says is that the universe today is bigger than it was yesterday, and is much bigger than it was a billion years ago. So as you extrapolate back, the universe gets smaller and smaller, denser and denser, and hotter and hotter. So as you keep going you get to a very small volume of space which is very dense and very hot. At some point in this extrapolation, our equations stop working because the volume becomes zero. But there were probably some other laws of physics that applied at this stage, perhaps some kind of quantum gravity, that is gravity at infinitesimally small scales. We don’t have such a theory yet. This is something that physicists are feverishly working on. Along the same lines, the universe today is expanding, but galaxies aren’t actually moving at that expansion rate. Only the space between galaxies is becoming larger and only on very large scales. Gravity also plays a role so that on smaller scales gravity still holds stars together within a galaxy, and certain nearby galaxies are still attracted to each other, like the Andromeda galaxy is to our Milky Way galaxy. While the whole universe may come from a tiny volume of space, cosmic inflation would have caused all points within that space to expand. And this expansion or inflation happened everywhere in space. There is no center of the universe or location. Every point moved away from every other point. Expansion faster than the speed of light during inflation also means that these points, while they may have been causally connected initially, would have moved apart after inflation, such that they became causally disconnected. This is because causality is limited to the speed of light. No information can travel faster than this speed. As a consequence of this, there are certain parts of the universe that we will never be able to see or detect in any way, because any light or gravity coming from it, will never reach us. Let’s now see how Inflation could explain the three problems with the Big Bang model – the observed homogeneity, the flatness issue, and the no observed magnetic monopoles issue. When we look out into space, we see that the universe on large scales is pretty much uniform. The universe is extremely homogenous and isotropic which is just physics jargon for saying, it appears roughly the same anywhere your look. This can also be seen in the cosmic microwave background, or CMB, where the tiny differences you see on this image represent temperature fluctuations of at most only 0.0001 Kelvin, or less than one ten thousand of one degree. To see how inflation explains why the early universe was so uniform, let’s imagine that before inflation, the universe was completely random. Maybe in one place the density was very high and a fraction of a millimeter off to the side the density was very low. You can imagine it like the surface of deflated balloon. There may be tiny imperfections like different thicknesses and wrinkles randomly distributed on it. Now imagine that this balloon is suddenly inflated to a very large size. A tiny fraction of a second later, the wrinkles on the balloon’s surface get smoothed out. Any density differences of the balloons skin become diluted. This is analogous to what happened during inflation as a tiny volume increased by at least 10^78X. Now let’s look the flatness problem. Imagine living like an ant on the surface of a very small balloon. It would be a 2 dimensional world. But if the balloon was tiny enough, it might be obvious to you that this surface was curved and that you were living in a closed or curved universe. However, if that ball expanded to the size of the Earth, it would appear flat to you, even though it is still a sphere on much larger scales. Now scale that up to human size and the ball being much larger than even the observable universe. To you, it would appear to be flat as far as you could see, even though it might have been obviously curved to start with. Inflation stretches any initial curvature of the 3-dimensional universe to near flatness. We don’t know if the universe is 100% flat, but if there is curvature, it is so small that we can’t measure it with our current technology. Note that when I say curvature, it would be an overall curvature of the universe in four dimensions. This is not easy to visualize, so we have to visualize it as the 3D curvature of a 2D balloon’s surface. A closed curvature for the universe would mean that two parallel lines would eventually converge in our 3D universe, just like two parallel lines on the 2D surface of a balloon converge. How does inflation solve the monopole problem, the fact that we can observe no magnetic monopoles in the universe. Well, monopoles can only theoretically form at very high temperatures, the kinds of temperatures that were only present during the big bang. But once they formed they should be stable enough to survive. The idea is that Inflation would have quickly cooled the universe because of rapid expansion, and only monopoles created prior to inflation would then continue to exist in the universe. But during inflation, the density of monopoles would drop exponentially, so their abundance would drop to undetectable levels because they would exist in such low densities. Imagine that just before inflation there were a thousand monopoles and they were all packed into a cubic meter of space. A fraction of a second later, those monopoles were spread out in a region 10^78 cubic meters across. This would make them so rare that we may never detect it. Now as the CMB attests, the universe is not completely smooth. We can see that there were small imperfections, small temperature differences. This is called the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. You might say well, doesn’t this ruin the idea of inflation if the universe isn’t completely uniform? No, these small anisotropies are exactly what we would expect. Inflation only makes the large scales like the CMB look uniform. But the small anisotropies can actually explain the origin of the observed structure in the universe. Prior to inflation, the universe we see today was microscopic. The quantum fluctuation within the density of matter on these microscopic scales could have expanded to astronomical scales during Inflation. And this is what we see across the universe as higher density regions condensed into stars, galaxies and galaxy clusters. Now the big question you may be asking is how did inflation start? What was responsible for inflation? This is not well understood. It is thought that there may have been a scalar inflation field during the time of the big bang. What is a scalar field? As an analogy, imagine a room with a fireplace in it. Every point in that room will have a temperature associated with it. So if you were to measure the temperature anywhere in that room, it will have some kind of distribution. We would be measuring just a magnitude of the temperature. This is akin to a scalar field. It has only a magnitude. Now imagine that same room with a giant magnet in the middle of it. Every point in that room will have a magnetic field which will not only have a magnitude, but also a direction. In other words, if you had a charged particle or small magnet somewhere in that room, that object would experience a force, that has not only a magnitude, but also a different direction depending on its location in the room. This is like a vector field. It has a magnitude AND a direction. Magnetic fields and gravitational fields are vector fields like this. The Higgs field and Inflation field are scalar fields analogous to the temperature in the room. From a theoretical point of view, assuming that an inflation field existed, we can show this field with the following diagram. In the very early, very hot universe, the inflation field would have had some value at the point a. This would have been the lowest energy density that the field could be in, at the high temperatures and energies of the universe at that time. The theoretical inflatons, or particles of the inflation field, would have remained at this point. However, point A would not have been the true vacuum, but a false vacuum, because as temperatures cooled, the field formed a lower energy potential at point c. Since A was not the lowest point in terms of energy density, it is called a false vacuum. The natural place for the field to be as the universe cooled, and got to lower temperatures and energies was actually C, the lowest energy density of the field. All natural systems tend towards their lowest energy state. So when the inflation field is stuck at A, it will tend towards C. But before it can get there it has to overcome a small barrier, B. This can be accomplished with the help of quantum tunneling. This can allow the field to overcome the barrier at B, and drop down to its lowest energy state at C. When the energy difference between point A and point C becomes very large, larger than any other energy in the universe, inflation starts. When the field reaches the lowest minimum energy density in the potential at point C, Inflation comes to a stop. This is a very short process because as I said earlier, inflation lasts only from about 10^-36 seconds to about 10^-32 seconds after the beginning. So the scalar field causes the almost-instantaneous, exponential expansion that we call cosmic inflation. As the field reaches its lowest potential, inflation ends, and it decays into other fields and particles. After this event, the universe continues to expand, but in the slower way that the original big bang model described. So inflation theory solves several problems in one fell swoop. In my next video, I will cover an even more fascinating aspect of inflation, and that is the theory of ""Eternal Inflation."" This theory, if correct, would mean that our universe is but one of a near endless myriad of universes, most of which are unimaginably bigger than ours. This could also actually explain why our universe is like the way it is. So stay tuned for that. I’d like to give a big shout out to professor Gary Felder of Smith College, who inspired this video.

Volataur™ with Jayme,1.0,wZDE-SWZAuE,prices went up infamously during the Carter presidency inflation was increasing and unemployment was increasing at the same time we are kind of with a problem of inflation inflation is our friend everybody feels very poor there's a lot of people that just aren't making it it's a tough problem the question is how long will this go on the vocal rule today I'm going to talk about the cause of the great inflation of the 1970s let's get started the great inflation was the defining macroeconomic event when the economy changed a lot it happened in the second half of the 20th century Here and Now declares unconditional war on poverty in America this period lasting from 1965 to 1982 caused economists to rethink the policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks over the almost two decades it lasted there were four economic recessions two severe energy shortages and the unprecedented peacetime use of wage and price controls after the global monetary system created during World War II was abandoned it was according to one prominent Economist the greatest failure of American macroeconomic policy in the post-war period that failure had a big impact on economic theory and the rules that control money policies at the Federal Reserve and other Global central banks if the great inflation was a result of bad American Economic Policy then fixing it should be counted as a success now let's go into the forensics of the great inflation in 1964 inflation was about one percent each year it had been in this range for the previous six years inflation began to escalate in the mid-1960s and reached more than 14 percent in 1980. it eventually fell to three and a half percent in the latter half of the 1980s while economists debate the relative importance of the factors that motivated and perpetuated inflation for more than a decade there is little debate about its source the great inflation was caused by too much money in the economy the Federal Reserve created this problem by promoting policies that encouraged too much growth in the money supply this episode of bad economic and monetary policy can be difficult to understand to make it easier to follow I will tell the story in three parts this is a forensic examination of the motive means and opportunity for the great inflation to occur the motive the Phillips curve and the pursuit of Full Employment first just what is the Phillips curve it's simply an economic concept stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship however the original concept has been disproven by what happened in the 1970s when there was high inflation and unemployment at the same time the unemployment rate soared to 8.2 percent Nationwide last month the first portion of the story The motive underlying the great inflation dates back to the immediate aftermath of the Great Depression when macroeconomic Theory and policy were similarly transformed after World War II ended Congress focused on creating policies that it hoped would promote economic stability the Employment Act of 1946 was one of the most important laws to come out of that time period among other things the ACT said that it is the responsibility of the federal government to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power and to make sure that there is better coordination between fiscal and monetary policies this act which is often regarded as the father of the federal reserve's modern dual mandate established the Federal reserve's current two-part mission to maintain long-term growth and monetary and credit Aggregates to promote effectively the goals of Maximum employment stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates after World War II many countries followed a policy called Keynesian stabilization this policy was motivated by the painful memory of high unemployment rates in the 1930s at the consumer level America may not look much like an economy in distress but in shops and supermarkets in the residential suburbs inflation is now beginning to bypass the goal of these regulations was to control how much people spend known as Demand by managing the government and Central bank's spending and Taxation policies as well as their monetary policies today the notion that monetary policy May and should be used to control aggregate spending and keep the economy on a stable track is still largely accepted but one critical and erroneous assumption to the implementation of the stabilization policy of the 1960s and 1970s was that there was a stable relationship between unemployment and inflation that could be exploited specifically it was generally believed that permanently lower rates of unemployment could be bought with modestly higher rates of inflation the idea that the Phillips curve represented a longer term trade-off between unemployment which was very harmful to economic well-being and inflation which was sometimes perceived as an inconvenience appealed to policymakers who wanted to implement the Employment Act strictly however the stability of the Philips curve was a dangerous assumption one that economists Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman warned about said Phelps if the statical optimum is chosen it is reasonable to suppose that the participants in product and labor markets will learn to expect inflation and that as a consequence of their rational anticipatory Behavior the Phillips curve will gradually shift upward to summarize If the Fed wanted to pursue a policy of lower unemployment and more inflation while maintaining price stability it would be making a false bargain in which inflation must rise ever faster in order to keep up now for the means the collapse of Bretton Woods chasing the Phillips curve in pursuit of lower unemployment could not have occurred if the policies of the Federal Reserve were well anchored and in the 1960s the US dollar was anchored albeit very tenuously to Gold through the Bretton Woods agreement so the story of the great inflation is in part also about the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the separation of the U.S dollar from its last link to gold during World War II the world's industrial Nations agreed to a global monetary system that they hope would bring greater economic stability and peace this system would promote global trade that system which was created by 44 nations in Bretton Woods New Hampshire in July 1944 provided for a fixed rate of exchange between the currencies of the world and the US dollar and the US dollar was linked to gold however the Bretton Woods system had a number of flaws in its implementation one of the biggest problems was that it tried to keep fixed parity between Global currencies which was incompatible with the domestic economic goals of different countries as a consequence many nations were pursuing monetary policies that would move the Phillips curve up and to the right in order to create a more favorable unemployment inflation link the United States status as the world's main currency has presented additional issues as global trade increased demand for U.S dollar reserves increased as well for a Time the demand for dollars was met by an expanding balance of payments deficit and foreign central banks amass more and more dollar Reserves eventually the number of dollar reserves held abroad exceeded the U.S stock of gold indicating that the United States could not maintain full convertibility at current gold prices a fact that would not go unnoticed by Foreign governments and currency speculators as inflation increased during the latter part of the 1960s people started to trade more US dollars for gold in the summer of 1971 President Nixon stopped this exchange so that the U.S dollar would not lose its value I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other Reserve assets for the first time in history the dollar was just a piece of paper backed only by faith in the Federal Reserve and its policies your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today promise was only as good as the FED actions behind it but bowing to pressure from Nixon and clinging to flawed economic theories the FED refused to raise rates [Music] over the next decade the cost of living more than doubled the dollar lost more than half its value during the next two years there was an effort to salvage the global monetary system through the brief Libs Smithsonian agreement but the new Arrangement fared no better than Bretton Woods and soon collapsed the post-war Global monetary system was finished the final link to Gold cut most of the world's currencies were suddenly and completely unanchored this was the first time in history that most of the money in the world was on a paper money standard that could not be redeemed for anything valuable now for the opportunity fiscal imbalances energy shortages and bad data the late 1960s and early 1970s were difficult times for the U.S economy inflation's built severe distortions into the economy on the industrial front it's the car manufacturers who've been hardest hit President Johnson's Great Society legislation brought about major spending programs across a broad array of social initiatives at a time when the U.S fiscal situation was already being strained by the Vietnam War these growing fiscal imbalances make it more difficult to make monetary policy in order to avoid interfering the treasury's funding plans the Federal Reserve followed a policy of conducting even Keel policies this meant the central bank would not alter its policy and would not adjust interest rates in the period between the announcement of a treasury issue and its sale to the market under normal circumstances treasury issues were rare and the fed's even Keel policies had little influence on the implementation of monetary policy however as debt problems became more prevalent the fed's adherence to the Ian Keel principle began restricting monetary policy a more disruptive force was the repeated energy crises that increased oil costs and sapped U.S growth the first crisis was an Arab Oil Embargo that began in October 1973 and went on for about five months during this period crude oil prices quadrupled I've been in two gas lines already this morning this morning why doesn't anybody contact the president why is he letting this happen to us they reached a plateau that held until the Iranian Revolution brought a second energy crisis in 1979. the second crisis tripled the cost of oil in the 1970s economists and policy makers began to understand that there were different types of inflation this was when they saw the increase in prices across all sectors demand and pole inflation was caused by government policies and specifically monetary policy it resulted from policies that produced a level of spending in excess of what the economy could produce without pushing the economy Beyond its ordinary productive capacity and pulling more expensive resources into play but inflation could also be pushed Higher by disruptions in the supply of food and energy this cost push inflation also got passed through the chain of production into higher retail prices from the Viewpoint of the Central Bank the increasing cost of oil was largely out of its hands but the increase in unemployment that was occurring in response to the jump in oil prices was not the Federal Reserve responded to a mandate to establish full employment with little or no Reserve management anchor by allowing huge and growing fiscal imbalances and fighting against the energy related headwinds these policies accelerated the amount of money in the economy and raised prices without reducing unemployment and Arthur Burns chairman of the fit he did not do what a good Central Banker should do and raise rates to break the inflation and by the time the 70s ended it was a total mess bad data or at least a bad understanding of the data also handicapped policymakers they've made decisions based on inaccurate information which resulted in them making poor choices looking back at the information policymakers had in hand During the period leading up to and during the great inflation Economist athanasio's orphanites has shown that the real-time estimate of potential output was significantly overstated and the estimate of the rate of unemployment consistent with full employment was significantly understated in other words policymakers were likely underestimating the inflationary effects of their policies in fact without increasing inflation the policy path there were almost simply untenable but wait there's more the Phillips curve which was a crucial reference for Federal Reserve policy decisions began a shift and finally from high inflation to inflation targeting the conquest of U.S inflation the stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment turned out to be unstable as Phelps and Friedman correctly predicted the ability of policy makers to control any real variable was not permanent this truth included the rate of unemployment which oscillated around its natural rate the policy makers hoped to find a trade-off but it did not exist as businesses and households came to appreciate indeed anticipate Rising prices any trade-off between inflation and unemployment became a less favorable exchange until in time unemployment became unacceptably high this became the era of stagflation in 1964 when this story began the inflation rate was one percent and the unemployment rate was five percent Ten Years Later inflation would be more than 12 percent and unemployment would be more than seven percent by the summer of 1980 inflation was approaching 14 and a half percent and unemployment was over seven and a half percent Federal Reserve officials were not blind to the inflation that was occurring and were well aware of their two goals to achieve full employment and price stability the Employment Act of 1946 was recodified in 1978 by the Full Employment and balance growth act commonly known as the Humphrey Hawkins act after the Bill's sponsors Humphrey Hawkins charges the Federal Reserve to pursue Full Employment and price stability the Central Bank must also set targets for different monetary Aggregates and provide a semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress despite this the employment half of the Mandate appeared to be more important when there was a conflict between Full Employment and inflation as fed chairman Arthur Burns would later claim full employment was the primary objective in the Publix and government's eyes if not also in those of the Federal Reserve however it was also clear that trying to solve the inflation problem would have been too costly for the economy and jobs there have been a few previous attempts to reduce inflation without the additional burden of higher unemployment the Nixon Administration put in place wage and price controls in three different phases between 1971 and 1974. the controls only temporarily slowed the rise in prices however I hope that independently he will conclude that My Views are the ones that should be followed this made the shortages worse especially for food and energy the Ford administration had no better luck when they tried to control inflation after declaring inflation Enemy Number One the tyranny of double-digit inflation is our common enemy in 1974. the president in 1974 introduced the whip inflation now program this voluntary program had measures to encourage people to save more money but it failed by the late 1970s the general public had come to expect an inflationary bias in monetary policy and they were increasingly unhappy with inflation many surveys showed that the public lost confidence in the economy and government policy during the second half of the 1970s and often inflation was identified as a special evil interest rates appear to be on a secular rise since 1965 and spiked sharply higher still as the 1970s came to a close during this time business Investments slowed down in productivity weakened the nation's trade balance with other countries worsened and inflation was seen as a major cause of the economic problems or the main reason for them but once policymakers found themselves in a position with high inflation and high unemployment they faced an unhappy dilemma is very difficult to fight high unemployment and inflation at the same time if you try to fight High inflation it could cause the unemployment rate to go up in 1979 Paul volcker who had previously served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was named chairman of the Federal Reserve board when he took office in August the inflation rate year over year was more than 11 percent and the unemployment rate was close to 6 percent by this time it was generally accepted that reducing inflation requires controlling the growth rate of reserves and money in general the Federal Open Market Committee had already started to set goals for how much money should be in the economy this is required by a law called the Humphrey Hawkins Act however it was clear that sentiment was changing with the new chairman and that stronger measures to control the growth of the money supply were required in October 1979 the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it would Target Reserve growth instead of the Fed fund's rate as its policy instrument even if it had the effect of temporarily disrupting economic activity and for a Time increasing joblessness inflation was now seen as essential to both aims of the Dual mandate in early 1980 Volker said my basic philosophy is over time we have no choice but to deal with the inflationary situation because over time inflation and the unemployment rate go together volcker had tried to get the FED Governors to nudge interest rates upward without success so he tried a different attack persuading them to focus on controlling the money supply it was a sleight of hand because the two are essentially the same but it was a politically palatable tactic and it worked and when he slowed the money growth rate predictably the interest rate went way up over time the desired slowing of inflation was achieved by having greater control over reserve and money growth although this was not perfect it worked well enough this tighter Reserve management was made stricter with the introduction of credit controls in early 1980 and with a monetary Control Act interest rates changed a lot in 1980. they went out then down for a bit and then would back up again lending activity fell unemployment Rose and the economy went into a brief recession between January and July inflation fell but was still high even as the economy recovered in the second half of 1980. however the volcker FED continued to fight High inflation with a combination of higher interest rates and slower Reserve growth in July 1981 the economy fell into a recession again which proved to be more severe and drawn out than the previous one unemployment peaked at nearly 11 percent but inflation continued to move lower and by the recession's end year-over-year inflation was back under 5 percent in time the fed's commitment to low inflation gained credibility and unemployment drop as a result of strong economic growth the great inflation was over yeah I think it's fair to say that was a difficult time by this time a macroeconomic theory had changed dramatically as a result of the economic lessons of the era in macroeconomic models the essential function that public expectations play in the link between economic policy and economic performance has become standard practice making time consistent policy choices choices that don't sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term gains and having policy credibility are important for good macroeconomic results today central banks understand that a commitment to price stability is essential for good monetary policy most central banks including the Federal Reserve have adopted specific numerical objectives for inflation these numerical inflation targets have helped to control inflation by providing an anchor for monetary policy and in so doing they have also increased transparency and reduced uncertainty now recognized to be critical prerequisites for long-term development and maximum employment so what can we learn from the great inflation of the 1970s for one it's a reminder that economic policies have real world consequences it also underscores the importance of keeping an eye on inflation and all other economic indicators to avoid nasty surprises down the road finally it serves as a cautionary tale about giving Central Bankers too much power something we should bear in mind as we watch current events unfold here at home
Garys Economics,1.0,GcaiTZKlCj4,"imagine you gave your house and all of your assets everything you own to some rich guy and then you took a massive loan from him and you gave the money back to him so now you're in debt to him he owns everything how can you not be poor and the answer is: you can't! all right so today we're going to do a nice educational one uh topical about the main issues which people are worried about today that we get asked about a lot which are inflation, interest rates and house prices often viewed I think as 3 separate concerns but they're very very linked they're very related so I think if we cover all 3 of these and the way they're related it can really help people to understand how the economy works and what's happening now right so we're going to start with inflation so the first thing is we've covered this before but I'll go over it quickly I believe and I've said this many times on the channel, that the inflation was largely caused by the enormous amount of money given out by this government and governments all over the world during Covid uh the amounts are truly enormous £700billion in this country (UK) which is 14,000 pounds per adult, eight trillion dollars in the US which is about 30,000 dollars per adult huge amounts of money given out that amount of money has to end up somewhere ends up in the bank accounts of private individuals largely wealthier private individuals which means huge huge, nobody is denying this by the way this is generally accepted, enormous accumulation of cash by richer individuals in the last three years during Covid which is the reason why I said in the first video on this channel that when we come out of Covid we will probably see a big jump in inflation because there would have been this massive cash accumulation with rich individuals okay um that has not generally been the mainstream media explanation of inflation and they've been generally saying it's because of sort of an anonymous after effects of covid which never really explained in much detail and of course the Ukraine war I'm not denying that the war in Ukraine has caused inflation especially with specifically with energy that is a part of it as well but I think a big part of it is this massive cash accumulation during Covid if you give a huge amount of cash out what you essentially do is you devalue the currency because most people especially the rich have huge amount more money, more money going around, they can buy more things, they can push prices up, prices go up and you know we predicted it in advance and it happened! what does that mean going forward okay so if I'm right and it was largely caused by this huge amount of money given out by the government you would expect a kind of relatively sharp jump in prices and then for prices to start going up much more slowly because the government gave a huge amount of money out in a short period of time and now they are still running a deficit higher than pre-covid and that is because basically there's been a massive increase in poverty since covid because of the inflation which means the government is now forced to for example subsidise people's energy which has cost the government, they're forced to provide more poverty benefits because people are struggling so the government gave a huge amount of money out and now they have to keep giving money up at a much slower rate so what I would expect to happen is a big increase in prices and then for prices to keep going up but not at this rapid rate so we've seen the big increase and what I expect happen now is that prices will will slow down they will keep going up because the government is still giving money out but they will not keep going up at the rapid rate so we will see a big fall in inflation um almost certainly it's important that people understand that a fall in inflation does not mean a fall in prices right, inflation is the rate of increase in prices so prices jumped a lot they will keep going up but that will slow down massively um inflation will probably fall to something like six seven percent maybe even lower this year that is just simply because the government is not giving so much money out the government will try and take credit for that but it's important to remember that if prices are still going up six seven percent a year then you know life is still getting harder life is still getting worse for you and the fall in inflation is really a fall in the rate of decrease of your living standards it's not really something for the government to be proud of okay so that's inflation covered for now inflation will probably normalise right I think it's because of the huge amount of money given out that that rich people still have, um other people think it's because of other things um let's move on to interest rates so interest rates have risen significantly here in the UK they're up to four and a quarter now (4.25%) financial markets... first thing to say is financial markets think that we are nearing the top now they think that interest rates will probably peak at something like four and a half maybe four and three quarters (4.5-4.75%) which means another just 1 or 2 increases in interest rates this year um I suspect that'll probably be right in the short term & then interest rates will start to slowly come down now there's been a lot of discussion about interest rates and I want to talk about this one because I think I think the situation is quite interesting right there's been a lot of criticism especially from the left, people saying what the hell is the Bank of England doing raising interest rates um and that's understandable because when the bank raises interest rates your mortgage rate goes up I think a lot of people are seeing massive increase in their mortgage rates it's causing a lot of problems um it increases the interest that the government has to pay on it's government debt government debt is massively increased in the last three years it's very large it's about 100% of GDP I think it's you know something like 30,000 pounds per person it's a lot um they have to pay a higher interest rate, if you have a mortgage you have to pay a higher interest rate um and people are understandably super stressed about that right and they're turning around to the Bank of England and they're saying 'well why are you doing this? because you're hurting us you're hurting us you're hurting the economy' and I think this provides opportunity for a really interesting discussion so the first thing to say is from my perspective the inflation has been caused by the government giving money out that has ended up with rich people and we discussed this exactly in the first video on the channel where we predicted the inflation right where we said if during covid the government is going to give 700 billion pounds to the rich the only way to avoid a crisis in inflation and inequality because that cash distribution increases both of those things, is to take money back from the rich through taxation policy you see that's symmetrical if I give you money then the way to reverse that and avoid the consequences of that are to then tax money from you okay but that's not what we're doing right what we're doing is the government has given money out which has ended up with the rich and then rather than taxing money back from the rich the Central Bank the Bank of England is increasing interest rates and this is because economists when they think of inflation they always think of interest rates this is what happens in economists minds if inflation is too high raise interest rates if inflation is too low lower interest rates these are like the articles of faith of being an economist they're really connected and they tend not to think in terms of fiscal policy so in economists minds they have these these ideas of two levers that rule the economy one is fiscal policy and that is government taxation and expenditure so during covid the government run a massive deficit that means they spent way more than they taxed, that is what they would call a fiscal stimulus, it's pouring money in in terms of government spending that's fiscal policy monetary policies is basically Central Bank interest rates it includes quantitative easing which we've covered before but I think to keep things simple let's just talk about interest rates and that is you lower the interest rate to speed the economy up, you raise the interest rate to speed the economy down it's important to recognise that these are two different things all right and both of them can affect inflation so if the government starts spending a ton of money and during Covid most of it's printed money that will push inflation up and if the Central Bank starts slashing interest rates that will also push inflation up but they're different things right and I think the most important thing to understand if you take anything away from this video is that we are clearly using the wrong policy to fix the inflation because if we cause the inflation by giving money to the rich then the way to fix it is to take money from the rich, if we try to fix it by raising interest rates what does that mean well interest rates are the money that is paid by borrowers in the economy to lenders in the economy and I remember we've covered this on the channel before that for every borrower there is a lender for every lender there is a borrower okay it's always perfectly matched you can't borrow money from nobody, you can't owe money to nobody okay so really when the Central Bank raises interest rates what they are doing is they are benefiting the lenders, so who are lenders? lenders are people with large amounts of money who lend money out you know largely it's wealthy individuals you know sometimes it goes through your bank so if you have a huge amount of cash in the bank, your bank lends that money to government, your bank lends that money to mortgage borrowers, if you have a lot of money in your pension, your pension fund lends that money to the government, lends that money to mortgage borrowers right so people with large amounts of cash benefit when interest rates go up and the people who lose are people who have large amounts of borrowing which is the government first and foremost and people with mortgages people with large mortgages which is largely younger homeowners & also it doesn't include homeowners from rich families who don't have to use mortgages right so when you raise interest rates often you are benefiting rich people because they have a lot of cash and your disadvantaging the government and mortgagees; people who have mortgages, that is increasing inequality and it's not as simple as that right because there are some poorer people have all of their money in cash you may feel that they benefit there might be some rich people have a large amount of debt for example I have a large amount of debt as part of my sort of trading portfolio but in general when you raise interest rates you're moving money from borrowers which is mortgage holders and the government, to lenders which is rich individuals especially older rich individuals so when the government has given money out it's caused two things to happen 1. a massive increase in inequality & 2. a decrease in the value of the currency which we see as inflation if it wanted to perfectly offset that then it would tax the rich back but for some reason, which as you know i'm constantly maddened about, taxing the rich has never really been seriously in the discussion here even though we've seen a massive increase in the wealth of the rich, so instead we've gone for the default which is raising interest rates now raising interest rates does increase the value of the currency so the one half of it which is the devaluation of the currency you are fighting by raising interest rates but the other half which was an increase in inequality, raising interest rates makes that worse right because you're forcing borrowers who are often not wealthy families, if you're wealthy you wouldn't take a mortgage and the government which means the taxpayer which means ordinary working people because as we know the very wealthy don't pay high rates of tax the taxpayer and mortgage holders have to pay more money to the cash holders which are the people who've accumulated huge amounts of cash during Covid, which is the rich, so in trying to fix with monetary policy by the bank of England a problem which was caused the fiscal or taxation policy by the government you've ended up trying to fix a crisis of inequality by more inequality so that that means that the long run situation for the economy and for for inequality is extremely bad but it will succeed eventually in bringing inflation down and this I think is there'll be people who there will be some people who won't like me saying this it will be unpopular with some there's been a lot of criticism from the left of the central bank for their interest rate policy they're saying you know why are you raising interest rates it's hurting people if the bank of England kept interest rates at zero the pound would have collapsed in currency markets the pound would be worth half of what it is now we'd be seeing an inflation crisis and I mean it would be very similar to what happened after the trussonomics disaster in Autumn so I think people who are pointing at the Bank of England (BoE) and saying this is your fault listen I've got no love lost for the Bank of England or Andrew Bailey um I think that they have no choice but to do this, the problem is because the government and the broader economics discussion in the media have said nothing about taxing the rich which would be the correct way to fix it, the Central Bank has no option but to raise the interest rates you know if we I think an interesting thought experiment is to sit and think what if we reversed the cash distributions of the last three years what if we went to every single person in the top 10% of the country and said we want £140,000 tax that would be a reversal like that it seems crazy but that is what we have done in the last 3 years we've distributed £140,000 to the richest 5 million people in the country each person right so if we took that back you would see a collapse in inflation a massive collapses these people desperately tried to raise that cash right so the interest rates had to go up because we have refused to have the discussion about taxing the rich and if you give a ton of money to the rich inflation will increase if you refuse to take the money back the only option central banks have to try and keep inflation is to raise interest rates and it will happen but in terms of looking forward I believe that the inflation will come down when it safely quickly which means that the central banks including the Bank of England, the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) will stop raising rates relatively soon um I think that once that inflation slows down you will start to see how severe the economic weakness is underneath how big the increase in poverty is and you'll probably start seeing in my opinion interest rates start to fall relatively quickly but that that depends on whether there's a bit of a balance here right because because we've seen such a big increase in poverty it creates creates pressure on governments to do more deficit spending and pump more money in & if governments are forced to pump more money in that could keep inflation higher over the long term and I think what you're seeing here is kind of the death throws of an economy which has given up on tax taxing the rich so if you cannot tax the rich and the rich have all the assets then you end up in a situation where whenever there's a crisis the rich get a ton of money and you can't get it back so the only option you have is to raise interest rates and that causes more poverty which means you have to give more money to the rich it's a question basically you're trying to solve the question of how do you prevent poverty when you are giving all of the assets to a group of people that you can get nothing back from it's almost a question of imagine you gave your house and all of your assets everything you own to some rich guy and then you took a massive loan from him and you gave the money back to him so now you're in debt to him he owns everything how can you not be poor and the answer is you can't so if you keep trying to provide living standards without the ability to tax the people who increasingly own everything it's not possible so you will continue to see this Balancing Act between the government has to spend a deficit which keeps inflation High but I think what you will see in this country I think the conservative government has a big political problem with high interest rates and that takes us to our next point which is house prices so how do you buy a house in a world where you're poor and the rich have everything the answer is you borrow the money from the rich and that that's mortgages and mortgages have been the way that we have squared this circle for the last 20 years in this country which is the conservative government has quite a political need for people to own property because private renters and social renters almost never vote conservative um they need house prices to rise because that's the only reason that older people feel comfortable because the house prices are rising so they need to keep people owning property but inequality is rising and rising, the middle class are losing their assets so how do we keep ordinary people owning property when inequality is rising because rising inequality of wealth means you lose your assets but we need you to lose your assets but keep your house how is that possible the answer is increasing debt so you can keep your house and you can just get more and more and more and more in debt to the rich that way you stay a property owner so you keep voting conservative but you become poorer and poorer generation after generation so it's really mortgages and debt I like the magic solution that works for the government and that has been working for them for the last 15 years quite well politically because the rich get richer and richer because you owe them more and more and more money but you keep your house so everybody's winning the rich get richer you get poorer but you keep voting for them because you're a homeowner and what you want is for asset prices to go up it's really really good for the conservatives and it's really bad for people in general and this is why higher interest rates are a disaster for the conservatives because they need ordinary people to be taking huge amounts of debt and huge amounts of debt are not affordable for ordinary people at interest rates of six seven eight percent which is what a lot of mortgage rates have gone up to right so they need interest rates to come down they need interest rates to come down desperately so I think what they will do and what you're seeing them doing is they will try their best to run as much as possible an extreme austerity government in the next year and a half in a desperate attempt to bring inflation down quickly so that interest rates come down and as soon as interest rates come down you will start to see those house prices go up because of the thing we mentioned at the beginning of the video which is that 700 billion pounds which has been given out by the government the last three years is still sitting in the bank accounts of the rich and this is the big conflict we have right the rich have all that money and what would the rich people do with money they want to buy assets so house prices want to go up but rich people themselves don't want to go out and buy a ton of houses right because buying houses is a hassle you know you need to manage tenants, super rich people don't want to be having to fix poor people's boilers things like this they don't want to be involved in stuff like that so what they normally do is they lend the money out they lend the money out but suddenly poor people can't afford to borrow the money anymore so it's created this it's created this two forces in house prices which is on the one hand house prices should be going up because the rich have got a ton of money and it's important to be clear house prices have gone up by about 20% since the beginning of Covid, and now they've come down about 3-4% so that force of the rich having a ton of money push house prices up but now the mechanism by which rich people buy houses and I think this is an interesting thing to consider mortgages are in a very real way the way that rich people buy houses so I've got half a million pounds and you've got nothing and you want a house there's two ways I can give you housing I can buy the house myself and I can rent it to you or I can lend you the half a million pounds you can buy the house and instead of paying rent you pay me Interest financially it's very similar if you think about it in both cases I provide all of the money for the house to be bought and in one case you pay me rent and other case you pay me interest so really mortgages are the way that the rich buy houses for the poor but that channel has become blocked because the poor can no longer afford the interest um so I think there are two things that can possibly happen here and the way it will play out will depend on the country one is in this country I think the government will do everything they can to bring inflation down but that will come at the cost of really crushing the economy and crushing ordinary people um I think the way they'll hope to survive that is by making a bit of room to like throw a load of money immediately before the election they will try to bring the interest rates down and as soon as interest rates come down then you will see this flood of money that the rich have again they continue to push house prices up even though they've already gone up 20% I think they can go up a lot more if you look at after 2008 house prices basically doubled over the next 10-15 years and I think they can do that again so if the interest rates come down then this channel will open up again the interesting question is what if interest rates don't come down which is what could happen if governments are forced to keep running big deficits in that case you'll have the question of how do the rich people buy their houses when they can't lend the money out and I think what you will see if that happens is the rich will start buying the houses through corporations and you will start to see much more corporate landlording so I lived in Japan for a long time and I think increasingly in the US you're seeing rather than the rich lending the pool of money via mortgages the rich pull their money together into corporations so there's I think it's is it BlackRock or is it Blackstone in the U.S it's a massive company which owns a huge amount of housing, rich people pool their money together in corporations the corporations buy the houses and the corporations lend the money out because it's quite interesting at the moment you're seeing rents go through the roof at the same time as house prices go down and the rich are sitting on a huge pile of cash so it's a it's a massive investment opportunity for wealthy people with cash because rents are super high and they've got a ton of money and the prices are cheap so the rich should be buying these houses and bringing the rent in but the problem simply is rich people are you know too lazy to go and buy 10 houses right and it's becoming more it's it's cumbersome right rich people don't want to be becoming massive buy-to-let landlords right so but either way the money is there and that will force house prices up in the long term and I think what you're just seeing is the the mortgage channel get blocked in the meantime um but what you would inevitably see in any case is the massive gift of cash to the rich will manifest in increased inequality of real assets either through much higher mortgages which means a much higher amount of debt from ordinary families to the rich, we've already seen a much higher debt from the government to the rich and what you will see is increased direct holding of properties I think it's important to realise when that mortgage channel gets blocked it provides a massive opportunity for rich people who can just pay cash they don't need a mortgage they can just buy cash at the cheaper price get in that massive increase in rental income rents are going absolutely through the roof and they can profit from that so every single step of the way, Covid management meaning massive cash transfer from the government to the rich, higher interest rates meaning higher debt payments from mortgagees and the government to the rich and falling house prices at the same time as high mortgage rates means cheaper access to housing if you have the cash, which only rich people do, every single step of the way is benefiting the rich and hurting ordinary middle class families and there's nothing that will prevent this if we don't start discussing more seriously taxation of the rich so to make clear the predictions you know inflation will come down um it will still be positive for a while interest rates will stop going up and I think they'll probably start coming down it might take a year or two um house prices they're clearly falling at the moment even though they're still significantly higher than pre-covid I don't think that will last I think as soon as interest rates start falling they will start going up and even if they don't you'll just start seeing more more Corporate Land lording & I know these are pessimistic predictions uh we get a lot of people saying that these are pessimistic predictions but this is what happens if you don't text the rich and if you don't want bad outcomes you cannot allow inequality to get higher and higher so support the channel we're always pushing for higher taxation of the richest and that's you know that's the only way we're going to prevent these things I know that these are not good for ordinary families we can't fix it without without improving taxation policy so let's do that okay thats all"
Zerodha Varsity,1.0,Qx3YMdcLTZo,have you ever asked anyone to help you understand what inflation is chances are you would have heard an example something like this a cup of coffee cost rupees 25 three years ago and the same cup of coffee today cost 40 rupees over the last three years the purchasing power of money has diminished and this is generally attributed to a phenomena called inflation this definition of inflation is all right in a nutshell it helps you understand what inflation is but you as an active Market participant an active Trader and an investor should try and understand what inflation is and understand all the nuances around it so in this video let's try and understand what inflation is and ways in which the central bank and the government control inflation imagine there is a person who wants to buy a box of chocolate and there's another person willing to sell this box of chocolate now all else equal with no external forces acting on this transaction the demand matches the supply and therefore this transaction will go through here there is no incentive for the seller to increase the price of the box of chocolates now let's try and flip the situation instead of one buyer let's assume there are 10 buyers willing to buy the same box of chocolates and there is only one seller of this box of chocolate or maybe a very small group of sellers now what do you think is likely to happen of course there's an incentive for the sellers to increase the price of box of chocolate because they would want to maximize on the opportunity hence the price of the box of chocolate is likely to increase of course the Assumption here is that all 10 buyers have the actual money to buy the box of chocolate and it's not a fake expression of Interest so if you strip this situation to its Basics you will realize that whenever there is a Nexus demand prices always tend to increase because the sellers of these goods or services would want to maximize on the opportunity but the key here is to identify that the demand itself is fueled by something called as liquidity which in other words is the availability of funds whenever such a situation pans out in the economy as a whole where the demand for goods and services tend to increase and the increase is actually backed by the availability of cash then it is referred to as liquidity lead inflation whenever inflation increases due to excess availability of liquidity in the system the Central Bank in our case The Reserve Bank of India steps in to control the inflation because excess inflation is neither good for the public or the economy but the bigger question to ask is what really leads to a liquidity-led inflation in the very first place let's take a recent example to understand this rewind back to 2020 when covet hit the entire world the public suffered businesses suffered and people lost jobs and people in general were afraid to spend money because of all the uncertainties that prevailed liquidity was tight central banks around the world wanted to inject money into their respective economies so that they could keep their economies floating now how do central banks inject liquidity into the system well one of the easiest way for them to inject liquidity into the system is by controlling the repo and the reverse report rates if you're not familiar with what repo and reverse report rates are I would encourage you to read this chapter on Varsity for a quick understanding when the repo and reverse repo rates are low Banks generally have access to cheaper Capital which they can borrow from the central bank and then in turn lend this at lower rates to the public the public can then borrow funds at lower rates from the bank and then fuel their purchases like Automobiles and homes not just that businesses too can borrow funds at lower rates and can fuel their capital expenditure programs in turn all these expenditures both from the public and the businesses side fuel the economy and helps the economy from not sinking so by lowering the rate Central Bank ensures that they don't let the economy from sinking and they also inject liquidity into the system apart from lowering the monetary rates central banks also participate in open market operations to inject liquidity into the system open market operations are the omo and the government security acquisition program also called the gsap are two Central Bank initiatives using which Central Bank infuses liquidity into the economy the central bank's open market operation is something that you need to understand let me explain like an individual the country too has an income and also has a set of expenses income is mainly in the form of tax Collections and the expense is mainly towards infrastructure and various government initiatives if the income matches the expense then it's all good but its seldom does as in the case of most economies the expenses exceeds the income and in economic terms when the expenses exceed the income it's called a fiscal deficit now to fund the fiscal deficit the Central Bank issues something called as the government bonds where they borrow money from the public and fund the deficit when the liquidity gets tight Central Bank steps in and why are their open market operation they start buying back these bonds from the bank prematurely which implies that the banks are now flushed with liquidity Banks use this liquidity to lend money and pass on the liquidity to Downstream economy by the way the open market purchase of Securities with an intent to flush the system with liquidity is also called as quantitative easing or the QE most people think QE is about printing money it is not to Summit Central Bank inject liquidity into the system by lowering interest rates and also via their open market operations but then excess liquidity for a prolonged period comes with a baggage demand for goods and services go up and as I explained earlier demand fueled by liquidity leads to inflation now when inflation increases the central banks will again have to step in and use the same levers that is the reverse repo repo and open market operations to control inflation and suck all the excess liquidity from the system apart from tweaking the Rapport reverse repo and the open market operations the Central Bank also tweaks something called as the crr or the cash Reserve ratio I've explained what crr is in this chapter of Varsity I would suggest you give it a read all that we've discussed so far is a liquidity-led inflation mainly stemming from the demand side but remember at the start of this video I did mention that inflation is a function of both demand and Supply imbalance let's quickly look at the supply side and how it impacts inflation going back when covet hit us the global supply chain was disrupted there was a shortage of everything which means the commodity prices increased countries producing Commodities holded all these Commodities hoping to release these Commodities at a much higher price you see what's happening here right with shortage of Commodities with the shortage of Supply the price tends to increase and that leads to inflation as well and this is ongoing as we speak the Russia Ukraine war still has a impact on all the Commodities especially oil now when oil prices increase it has a ripple effect on the entire economy including the inflation to sum it up the demand side inflation can be controlled by the Central Bank policies whereas the supply side inflation can be controlled by government policies to control the supply side inflation the government has to step in and take up a series of steps like lowering the duties to make essential Commodities more affordable imposing curves on export so that Commodities are available in domestic markets by the way before I end this video here is how you can keep track of all the important policy rates in the economy so as you see inflation has two sides to it and you as a market participant will have to keep an eye on all these factors and figure how things are panning out in the economy only then will you be in a position to anticipate things in advance and set up better trades I'll see you guys in the next video foreign
Not An Economist,1.0,bgKq6FQB6BM,"(gong reverberating) - [Narrator] Why has the cost of balloons risen in the past 10 years? Because of inflation. Inflation is a dangerous and sometimes fatal disease for a society. A classic example is the extreme case of Germany, Austria, and Russia after the First World War, when the inflation reached levels at which employers would pay their workers three times a day, after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they could go out and spend the money before it lost all its value. But you don't have to go to such extremes to see the harm which inflation, left unchecked, can do. We need to ask ourselves what is the cause of this disease called inflation, how do you cure the disease, what are the effects and side effects of the cure, and what will happen if we don't cure it? The first step to understand the cause of inflation is to recognize that it is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. It's always and everywhere a result of too much money, of a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output. We must also recognize that today, governments control the quantity of money, and as a result, inflation in the United States is created in Washington and nowhere else. Government, just like any of us, doesn't want to take responsibility for bad things. If something bad happens, it wasn't our fault. Politicians often say that inflation is produced by greedy businessmen or by unions or by spendthrift consumers, or maybe it's those terrible Middle Eastern countries that produce it. Yes, businessmen are greedy, trade unions are grasping, and, of course, the consumer is a spendthrift, but who of us isn't all those things? The trick is that none of them can produce inflation since none of them can print money. Only Washington has the printing press, and therefore, only Washington can produce inflation. Communists might tell you that inflation is a capitalist phenomenon. That is not true. If you look at Cuba today, which is a communist country, it has an inflation rate closer to 5%. One of the slowest rates of inflation has been in Switzerland, which is a capitalist country, so inflation is not a capitalist or a communist phenomenon. It is a printing press phenomenon. This has been documented over and over again. There is evidence for United States for 150 years, Great Britain for 200 years, Sweden for 200 years. You might also hear the trade unions cause inflation by pushing up the wages, but what about countries like Venezuela that has the highest inflation rate in the world at the moment, but has an authoritarian regime where trade unions don't have any power? We must ask why is it that the quantity of money increases relative to output? Sometimes it increases because of discoveries of gold and precious metals. The Gold Rush in California and the Australian gold discoveries in the late 1840s and early 1850s caused a worldwide inflation as a result. We also had a worldwide inflation because of the perfection of the cyanide process of extracting gold. But those were the old, good days. Now, governments figured out a better way of controlling the quantity of money by ending the link to gold and instead turning to government-dominated money. So today, you won't get an inflation for those reasons. Today, you have inflation because governments create a very large quantity of money. The question is why? The first and most important reason is government spending. First, we ask Congress to spend more money on us, and then we ask them to tax us less. You can't do one without the other. If the federal government spends 6 trillion and raises only 3 1/2 trillion in taxes, who do you suppose pays the other 2 1/2 trillion? Santa Claus? You paid and I paid, and one of the ways we paid is by tax called inflation. Inflation is a form of taxation. When government spends more than it takes in taxes, it meets the difference by printing more money. Printing money is very attractive for a politician who is trying to meet the demands for his or her re-election. It is really taxation without representation. Government has two other ways of getting revenue other than printing money with the tax system that we have in place. Let's say the prices go up 10% and your income goes up 10%. You think you're in the same position, but you are not. You are pushed to a higher bracket of income. And on average, in a situation when price and income both go up 10%, your taxes will go up 15%. So in fact, politicians are again in a marvelous position where they vote to lower taxes. When in fact taxes are going up, all of these tax cuts you hear about on TV are not tax cuts at all. Inflation has raised taxes and so-called tax cuts have given back a small part of that to the taxpayer, but the actual taxes to be paid have gone up because of inflation. In the third place, government gets revenue from inflation by canceling out its debt government debt is not something to be worried about. In fact, anybody who has bought a longterm government bond and then redeemed, it has gotten back an amount of money, which has less purchasing power, less ability to buy goods and services than the sum he initially paid for the bond and to add insult to injury, he has to pay taxes on what they call interest. And as a result, the debt has gone down in meaningful terms. So inflation is a marvelous resource for a government in all three of these ways. That has been the main reason throughout history and not only now, but going back for thousands of years. There was a great inflation during the time of the Roman Empire, when they acquisition was an emperor. He did it by taking full bodied silver coins and replacing them by an alloy that was worthless until there was less and less silver until he became a copper coin with a wash of silver, the American treasury was replacing our full-bodied silver coin by a copper coin with not even a wash of silver, only a nickel. History does repeat itself. Another less important factor are the mistaken policies by the federal reserve. First, it was at fault for producing the depression during the 1930s, by reducing the quantity of money in the US by a third. And today it is making a mistake in the opposite direction. Their mistake has almost always been caused by confusing their function by thinking that they had something to do with the interest rates, instead of recognizing that their real function is to control the quantity of money. You might say, what about international influences? We get the inflation from abroad and government is quick to blame other countries that might have been a valid explanation before 1971, when we had a worldwide system of fixed exchange rates. In that case, it is true that inflation in one country would tend to spill over into another. But today countries have variable exchange rates between their currencies, that update and adjust every second. And as long as that is true, inflation is a national phenomenon and not an international phenomenon. Just like every country that has high taxes, but high taxes is not an international phenomenon, it is just that many countries do it at the same time. Same way with inflation, if it was an international phenomenon, how comes Switzerland has an inflation rate, less than 1%. Ukraine has closer to 8% and Venezuela has 5000%. The cure to inflation is very simple in order to stop inflation, you have to have the government spend less and print less. That's the only way we're going to stop inflation. But you know, the real problem is not how to cure inflation, the real problem is to have the political will to do so. Every smoker knows that smoking is bad yet they continue to do it. Alcoholism is another great analogy for inflation. When you are out drinking the good effects come first and the bad effects come on the next day with a hangover, same happens when the governments print money. Everyone thinks they are richer, it makes business good expense output. It is only after a while that inflation happens. Similarly, when trying to cure an alcoholic, the bad effects come first and good effects come later. It is exactly the same with inflation, just as inflating stimulates the economy temporarily slowing down, inflation slows down the economy temporarily. Another reason why it's hard to cure inflation is because it's not clear if people want to do it. Everyone complains about inflation, but many people also benefit. If you bought a house in the past 20 years, you were able to borrow on a mortgage, which inflation has paid off. Almost all homeowners have benefited. One of the biggest reasons why inflation is such a bad social disease is precisely that it tends to be divisive. Some people do really well and some people do very badly. Let's emphasize that bad effects are not themselves, the cure of inflation. They are side effects of the cure. And in the same way, unemployment is not a cure for inflation, but it is almost an inevitable side effect of an effective cure. Now we should ask why is it that there seems to be no way to cure inflation without going through a period of a relative slow growth and relatively high unemployment. The answer are the time delays between printing money and the ultimate effects on output and prices. Suppose the government prints money and spends it to pay for its expenses. In the beginning, the people who find themselves doing better business don't know what the explanation is. Government is paying more money. Its employees have better salaries. They are coming and buying more goods. The storekeeper is happy to sell them at the same price as before. Each person thinks there is something special happening to them. The clothing manufacturer thinks that the demand for clothing is going up. It doesn't recognize that the demand is going up everywhere and not only for clothing. And that is going to have to pay more to get labor more, to get raw materials and for general production. After a while, he finds out that the costs are up and he's forced into raising the prices. This is why on average, an increase in the quantity of money takes five or six months to affect people's spending. First people just start having bigger bank accounts. It takes them some time to realize that and start spending the money. It takes another 12 to 18 months before that shows up in the prices. So on average, over the past 150 years in the United States and 250 years in Britain, there has been a two year interval between a more rapid increase in the quantity of money on the one hand and the inflationary effects on the other. If the government slows down, its spending people experience a slower demand for their products and they tend to cut back on production. It is only after a considerable interval that it is reflected in lower prices or in a slower rate of increase in prices. So there is no way that we know of to avoid the interim effect of slowing down inflation. Another resemblance between inflation and alcoholism is that when a fellow first gets started on drinking, all it takes is one drink to make him happy. But after his buddy gets adjusted, it takes bigger and bigger doses. Likewise, as a country gets accustomed to higher and higher inflation, it needs a bigger dose to have any stimulating effect. There is no way to avoid bad side effects, but they can be minimized by taking the cure gradually. Other than cutting government spending and stopping the printing press, we can minimize the side effects of inflation by adopting the widespread government program with respect to taxes. It is a disgrace and a scandal that we have not had legislation, which has adjusted the income tax system, so that inflation doesn't automatically raise rates. Congress has been very quick to index its own salaries and salaries of government employees, but it has been very reluctant to apply the same principle to the taxes that it imposes on the citizen. Instead, we should go the other way We should index Congress and government official salaries perversely. Every 5% inflation is a 5% reduction in their salaries. And I assure you, we would cure inflation really fast, But what if we don't cure inflation? We have no good choices. We will also have high unemployment. One of the main reasons is because of the false cures that will be attempted. In every country that had great inflation, the governments have resorted sooner or later to wage and price controls supposedly as an attempt to cure inflation. United States did that in 1971 with disastrous results. In fact, they are imposed by governments that want to inflate, but wants to conceal it from the people. The inflation in the United States really started in the early 1960s, when John F. Kennedy became a President From 1960, we have been on a rollercoaster. We have been going up in inflation and coming down Every time we go up, there is a great outcry that we have to do something about stopping inflation. And so we tend to step on the brakes that tends to produce a recession. But when unemployment starts going up, there is an even bigger outcry. We have to do something about the unemployment. So we step on the accelerator instead of the brakes and we're off again. The problem is that each peak of inflation has been higher than the previous peak. Each bottom has been higher than the previous one, just like an alcoholic who need higher doses to feel stimulation. The tragedy of this whole history is that we have time and time paid for the price of stopping and inflation and not gotten the benefit. We step on the brakes, we've taken a recession, we've had high unemployment, and then just as inflation was starting to taper, we started printing money again. Unfortunately, given the amount of money that has been pumped into the economy, we have only two bad choices. If we slow down drastically in order to try to hold back, inflation, the economy will experience a recession and it may be a fairly severe recession. Alternatively, you can say, well, we can do that. We've got to step on the gas, keep doing what we're doing now. Then you are condemning the economy to go into another period of double digit inflation. It must be said that the congressmen are not at fault for this. It is us, the American people who are not telling the government what we want to do. And when we decide that we want to stop the rollercoaster, there will be no technical difficulty in doing so. Let's emphasize it will not be costless to stop it, but it will not be costless to continue what we are doing now. We have a disease called inflation. Fortunately, our basic constitution is strong and we're a strong, healthy country. Although we have been doing our best to make it unhealthy, we have been doing our best to take measures that will reduce our productivity. Sooner or later, I am sure we will get to cure inflation, but until then we will be paying the price either way. I hope you're having a nice day.

He approached him and finally asked, ""Why are you acting so hyper, inflation? (smooth jazz music)"
Think Econ,1.0,aaVH6m6srdk,"Hey everyone and welcome back to our channel. We are absolutely blown away at the recent support of the channel. We're really close to 500 subscribers so if you want to be the 500th sub the button is all yours for the clicking. Today we're going to be looking at a topic that's really been making headlines lately, and that's inflation. Currently the inflation rate in Canada is reaching numbers we haven't seen in over 18 years, since early 2003. While a portion of high inflation can be attributed to global shortages in supply, in this video we're going to look at the implications of printing money and answer the question: ""Why does printing more money lead to high levels of inflation?"" With that said let's get right into things! Have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts, or to feed the homeless, or to fix unemployment, or any other issue for that matter? Now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions people might be a bit too embarrassed to ask and there's definitely no shortage of people wondering. The answer is inflation. Inflation is defined as a ""persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money and resulting in the loss of value of currency."" So first let's determine what exactly money or currency is. Now this may seem obvious but something that's important to know is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value. What that means is that money itself has no actual value, it's only considered valuable because it can buy things. If you watched our last video you would know this as the term ""fiat money."" An easy way to wrap your head around fiat money having no value outside of the value the government assigns for it is to think, if you were stranded on a desert island, money would be completely useless. Money has been around for thousands of years, however when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money. Again if you need a reminder of what this is, feel free to check out our previous video. Things were traded that had actual value and uses like salt, spices, horses, or weapons, as well as precious metals such as gold and silver; which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to their rarity or scarcity are almost universally accepted as currency. We slowly phased out of using commodity money as it became difficult for you to store your wealth. You'd have to carry it around with you all the time. Then we came up with something called representative money. Since carrying everything around all the time can be difficult, representative money made more sense. Basically you give your gold to the bank and the bank keeps it safe for you and in return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own the gold. These pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go to redeem them for gold at any time. These have evolved over time to the bank notes which we now refer to as dollar bills. These dollar bills are fiat money. Today almost every country in the world uses fiat money. So basic economics tells us that the more money in the economy the lower the value of each dollar. This is due to money becoming less scarce. Money is now easier to come by and since there's more of it in the economy the prices of goods and services must also increase to catch up to this increase in money supply. Let's look at an example. If everyone in Canada woke up and saw that the Bank of Canada had given one million dollars to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a new Lamborghini we would eventually run out of Lamborghinis. But do you see the issue here? The value of money is so deflated that people have too much of it. There's only a finite number of Lamborghinis available in the country. Do we see the problem here? Let's use a different analogy to demonstrate this. Imagine there's four people on a desert island and each of them have 10 pieces of various fruits, and all the fruits are considered absolutely equal in value. Now imagine they discover an entire forest of apple trees on the island. The nominal value of apples has increased because there's more apples on the island but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply. Nobody really wants to trade for apples anymore since they can just go to this apple forest and get some themselves. Therefore it now cost 10 apples to trade for one banana since the demand for apples is now low but the demand for bananas is still high. Just to clarify, in this analogy the people represent different countries, the fruits their respective currencies, and the apple forest is all that extra printed money. So to summarize what we've been saying; increasing the supply of money unambiguously decreases its value as it's much more readily available and easier to obtain, therefore less scarce. This creates inflation as prices of goods and services must increase to keep up with the current amount of money in circulation. You can run into some serious issues however when inflation or the increase in the price of goods and services exceeds the rate at which people earn money, which in turn creates prices of necessities that are too expensive for people to pay and the cost of living being unaffordable.

Daniel Iles Shorts,1.0,3qj_TyK4UQ0,this hundred dollar bill will soon be worth half of what it is today and this ten thousand dollars will only be worth five thousand dollars let me explain I'm I'm not gonna tear this see the government can print money and just make as much as they want and in the last few years they printed sixty percent of all dollars in existence but if everyone has more money no one has more money and the purchasing power of a dollar just decreases because the supply of money is increasing the value of each individual dollar is decreasing and if inflation continues it'll only take 14 years before
The News with Kamera Jr.,1.0,rfp_5g7yrTs,everybody keeps talking about inflation but what the heck does it mean inflation inflation inflation inflation is it an underwater animal that looks like a giraffe with backgrounds is it a place you go to on the highway where everything is expensive and it makes you wonder if you should buy a bike is it a thing happening every month that makes every woman go out and every man go so what is inflation and why do people keep talking about it here's some cute bunnies to break it down for you inflation is when a carrot that used to cost one dollar now costs five dollars is when prices are going up it can be because growing carrots is becoming expensive for the farmer so bunnies have to pay the extra cost it can be because governments and banks are printing more banknotes which makes the value of money go down it can be because raccoons and hamsters decide to buy carrots too more people want to buy the same carrots which makes them more valuable and the price goes up basically inflation defines how much money is worth but depending on how high or low it is it can make the same hundred dollar bill buy your yacht a house a pencil or a carrot
TraderNick,1.0,I7nPzjvIhiI,[Music] in this video we're talking all about inflation and how Traders can use the inflation studies that we're about to discuss to improve their trading dramatically fundamentals are not something that most retail Traders use but they are incredibly powerful and most hedge fund managers big Traders professionals incorporate some level of fundamentals in their trading in fact most hedge funds rely more on fundamentals than they do on technicals so if the pros are doing that we as regular Traders here on uh you know out in the streets we should try and incorporate some level of fundamentals as well so in this video we're going to talk all about inflation and I'm going to explain it to you in the simplest way I can so that you don't have to go to four years of of Economics to you know college in order to understand the stuff I'm going to try and keep it relatively relatively simple and keep it relevant to a Trader we're not just going to talk economics we're going to talk about how you you as a Trader can tangibly use this information that is so often talked about on tv YouTube you know all sorts of financial Outlets they're talking about inflation constantly so let's get into it inflation explained and notably how to profit from it how can we actually take advantage of understanding the inflation readings and where they may be going next well first of all we need to know what inflation is and to understand that why Traders should care we have to understand kind of what implications the inflation readings of the world have on real world everyday stuff as well as financial markets so inflation is in its simplest form it's the rise in the price of goods and services it actually can be the rise or the fall of price and goods it's like when you go to the store one day and something costs to I don't know ten dollars and the next hit costs you 11. that change in price may not seem like a lot but it is incredibly impactful to the global economy to the local economy to the consumer and all sorts of levels and this has a massive impact on the financial Market because inflation can be you know how many of us have gone to the gas pumps and it's suddenly very very expensive and that hurts your pockets right that impact is massive on financial markets and again we're going to explain it and understand how to benefit from it in this video so it is basically the rise in prices of goods and services I'm talking anything from getting your car filled up with fuel to buying something at the grocery store to renting an apartment all of these things are of course they have goods and services that are priced in a certain way and watching those prices is powerful so another way of thinking about inflation is it's actually the loss of Fiat purchasing power so if the price of stuff is going up what's actually really happening is the value of your dollar or Euro or Canadian dollar or whatever you're using your pound whatever you're using you if prices are going up around you it's not just prices going up what it's really doing is it's really the power of your currency is going down it's losing value and if you looked at any long-term chart maybe we can show something on the screen right now this is the purchasing power of the United States dollar over time and you can see it loses one of the worst long-term Investments you can own is just holding cash under a mattress you know like all those uh you know people who would who would hide their cash into the mattress and think that they're safe well you can't hide from inflation none of us can it's a really powerful force that is pretty persistent in financial markets the last couple hundred years actually for longer than that even back to the Roman times there were periods of elevated inflation anyways that's another history lesson wrong channel for that let's get into of course the uh the concepts here so you can see this this red line here is the price of goods and services and of course the blue line is the Fiat purchasing power and again these things usually move in the opposite direction your currency usually over time becomes value less and again we have to be aware of that but also it has hit big impacts on finance digital markets so why should Traders care so why does this matter to you and I if we're trading each and every day especially if you're a day trader this doesn't matter to you at all right wrong day Traders have a fallacy of thinking that you know economic figures don't impact them but they certainly can create some very strong Trends in the market and knowing what those Trends involve and what they entail from the inflation figures can be very powerful so let's talk about this so TR the reason Traders should care is because these central banks care the Federal Reserve here in the United States the Bank of Canada and Canada the bank of England in the UK the ECB or the European Central Bank these places Watch inflation really really carefully because it can make or break an economy and so central banks have a very strong interest in keeping inflation at or near two percent per year that is the Western Financial thought process that basically around a two percent inflation level is ideal that is a level it will get into why that's so ideal in just a moment but it's a healthy pace of inflation it's not too hot it's not too low and we'll talk about that in just a moment but what you have to understand is that as a Trader the simplest way to understand it is that why should you care the most powerful Financial entities in the world that move markets the most they care tremendously about this topic so to the actions of central banks this this is a really important part here the actions the central banks may take to accomplish this agenda of keeping inflation at a at or around two percent per year uh really moves the markets because what they may do to to uh stop or or uh you know cool or raise inflation is all about the interest rates they can rise interest rates or or let interest rates go down cut rates or hike rates and this has a massive impact on the financial Market we'll talk about that in just a moment so first of all we need to talk about how can we as you know regular people how can we view what inflation is actually looking like well we have what is called the CPI this is the Consumer Price Index and if you've never heard of this the Consumer Price Index is basically a way to track the changes in prices of goods and services over time now the CPI is basically I like to think of it as like a basket of different things picture like a basket with a bunch of item items in it like you have like a Coca-Cola can and a McDonald's you know McFlurry in there I don't know just like a bunch of random things and if we were to track these prices over time within this basket we could check the price of the overall basket over time we could get an idea of what uh broadly speaking prices are doing in the United States or if we're studying this Basket in Canada or the UK we can study their respective CPI basket as well so CPI has several components I've drawn A Little Wheel here and all this is just representing here is what actually makes up the basket of CPI stuff now each one of these are kind of a basket in their own so it's like baskets within a basket kind of thing but basically understand that CPI components at its simplest form involve things like food and beverages uh energy which is like of course like gasoline and things like that housing which is anything from Apartments to home purchases Transportation Medical Care Recreation and other so the reason I point this out to you is that within the CPI lots of different things can impact what the CPI actually turns out to be and the number one thing or another thing you need to know about this is that in red you can see this is the most volatile stuff the most volatile stuff is definitely going to be your food and energy what do I mean by that well these prices fluctuate the most energy if you watch the oil markets going up and down all the time and the price that we pay at the pumps is pretty constantly changing and this has a lot of impact and can very much sway what the CPI is looking like so some uh some some Traders prefer to actually look at the core CPI now the core CPI removes a couple of those very volatile things and looks at some of the more staple Goods to get a more reliable look at what prices are really doing so most volatile gets actually removed you can see they're crossed out so we remove food and energy from the equation to get a better look at what inflation is looking like um now again CPI is a way to measure inflation the reason you need to understand this is because this is how we're going this is what we're going to consult in order to make trading decisions so now that we know what the inflation reading the CPI the Consumer Price Index what that actually is and why it matters we can now talk about with those measurements what do we do with them well we have to understand what these measurements can kind of tell us about the economy and where things are headed so here's the thing when we take a look at inflation in terms of a position what's the positioning of inflation right now I've broken it down to three broadly speaking categories of inflation that I pay attention to the first one here is when CPI is 1.5 percent remember the ideal spot was two percent that's again in terms of like what the Bank of Canada and the bank of England and what the FED they generally speaking they want two percent inflation per year so if things are lower than that if we're seeing for example CPI under 1.5 percent 1.5 or less I like to call this area disinflation this is not a perfect number by the way this is just my educated guess under or at 1.5 percent we're going to call that kind of disinflation and this is actually not good now again remember why two percent why not zero percent well too little inflation is actually tough because um you know I'll show you this this this we're going to jump down to this section here for a second low inflation shows economic recession potentially and a lack of demand and growth because think about it if prices are not being bid up by consumers consistently that shows that there's a lack of demand maybe people aren't buying you know items at the store they're they're saving their money or people aren't renting apartments and bidding up rents obviously that sounds like you know that might be a good thing for you and I and of course you know in some ways it would be but for the economy not so much because that lack of spending and lack of money movement is not so great for an economy again we don't want too much of that either because too much inflation I've marked it as 3.5 percent or more in terms of the CPI uh that is what we call Hot inflation and in 2022 we experienced that quite a bit inflation remained very elevated and in the U.S went up to like nine percent now nine percent is far away from two percent and there was some serious concerns around that so high inflation uh it can lead to Runaway prices which can hurt the economy quite a bit as you can probably imagine runaway prices are no fun for any of us if you're thinking about trying to get a new house or buying a new car anybody trying to get a car during 2022 it was a nightmare the the prices of used cars and new cars they were flying high because consumers were bidding up those prices now sometimes it can actually be like in the case of 2022 we had supply line issues due to the Russia invasion invasion of Ukraine we saw a lot of supply line issues across the board same thing with kova these things cause inflation because a lack of Supply creates a huge amount of demand and everybody rushes for products bidding them up to the heavens it's not fun for consumers and what it actually can do is it actually can lead to an overheating of the economy people are rushing product prices so high that the consumer gets squashed and they can't afford anything and maybe some of you guys might say that sounds a little bit like the United States today and other places of course like you know the UK is experiencing this as well many places are it can be very devastating and this is why the FED wants that inflation not to go too high the last thing they want is to overheat the economy and kill the consumer to the point that there's a massive recession that follows this has happened in the past in the United States uh you know go take a look at some of the times in the previous uh you know decades where we saw very elevated levels of inflation and it led to some really tough years afterwards so will that happen here in the United States right now many people would speculate that that could be the case and that's why in the last few years uh with all this inflation people now have like a slight chance of a recession uh here in the United States that could be pretty devastating due to all the the prices running up so much like they have so the point is high inflation not so good really low inflation not so good sweet spot inflation which I've marked here on this as 1.5 to 3.5 inflation is Comfortably within the realm of what the FED kind of wants it's not perfect 3.5 is pretty high 1.5 still low but I like to call this just generally speaking pretty close to where things have have you know uh kind of gotten back to where the FED wants them during this time here in 2023 2023 has been incredibly bullish year for stocks and I'm I'm going to break this down here what each one of these categories tells us about financial markets because this is the part that is really key if you know how markets generally behave in each one of these categories you can use that to your massive Advantage which is something that I use in my own trading so we'll get into that next so again remember that the fed's goal is to keep moderate inflation with Max employment so how do they do that well here's what they do okay so in this category here the disinflation period what the Federal Reserve has as its tool is interest rates now I'm talking Federal Reserve for the US dollar example if you're in the Bank of England territory you're talking about UK that's a different story we're just talking here as an example in the U.S uh example okay so for the Federal Reserve if they see CPI is you know very low what will they do well they might choose to cut interest rates making borrowing more accessible to businesses and to Consumers who may want to go out and buy a car or buy a house so in this case fed May cut rates okay in this case that has some implications on the market we'll talk about that in just a second in the middle spot Sweet Spot the FED is pretty content they may in this case fed May hold they might just be good to keep interest rates at that level again they raise interest rates to slow the economy down they cut interest rates to speed the economy up this is their measurement this is again Western philosophy of how financial markets can work uh and then next let's talk about the last one which is of course high levels of inflation the FED May hike interest rates okay so this is what we saw if you're watching this video relatively recently to when I want to record this in 2022 and 2023 we've sent a lot of rate hikes because inflation has been on the upper limits of this it's been very hot inflation in the last year and a half well the FED does what they raise rates to try and keep things under control next up we've got to talk about how to trade it and this is really key because in the case of using this information there's three different categories that I've broken down and three different ways to look at them in a disinflation environment where things are really slow this in my opinion and and studying traditionally kind of Market sentiment this is generally speaking in a really low period This is a scary time this is recession this is fear in the world this is uncertainty if central banks and economies will be able to survive all that good stuff not so good it's like 2008 this is terrible right it's a really really tough time the this generally speaking can be a really positive scenario for gold and silver as people may be very very fearful of what's going to happen and move out of the dollar move out of stocks and go into something good old-fashioned like gold and silver this is also a time where maybe other currencies like the Japanese Yen or other stronger currencies out there may look more attractive relative to our US dollar example here so again uh it's bullish for gold for silver other currencies that look stronger and healthier and finally also bonds bonds typically do well during recession as people may um you know think that rate cuts are coming and again bonds trade heavily based on what interest rates are going to do and so as we'll speak about probably in a future video about interest rates this is a really important thing by the way if you're enjoying the video do me a quick favor hit that Thumbs Up Button And subscribe if you're new we have more videos like this coming these are a lot of work to put together so if you do enjoy these types of videos again help us out hit that thumbs up button for the algorithm okay finally we also have bearish stuff in a disinflationary environment where inflation is very low or possibly shrinking stocks and indices don't look great because again this is showing that the demand in the economy is really low and low demand is probably not going to do well for companies who are really struggling finally we also have the US dollar down or bearish because people are probably not going to be too confident in the US dollar when the economy is totally slowing up and again bond prices are going up yields are going down people are very concerned think about it this way dollar not so good in a disinflationary environment so something to think about there the next category is talking about The Sweet Spot when inflation is at what the Federal Reserve probably deems a pretty healthy zone or at least close to that two percent Target this environment is totally different than the first one and the last one in this case we're actually in my opinion this is where you want to be very bullish stocks and indices and equities and things like that like this is the period where if things look confident things look okay the fed's not going to raise interest rates on you and you're economy looks pretty strong all of these things great time to buy stocks and indices personally one of my favorite styles and timings to trade stocks and indices is in The Sweet Spot environment in fact we briefly have kind of come back closer to that area since 2022's Mayhem and it's been a really great year for me in 2023 trading primarily stocks and indices uh you know during kind of coming back into a little bit more of a sweet spot will it stay there we'll see again things are still developing every day but anyways the next thing is of course during this period of time we also see uh non-usd currencies doing well because again this is kind of an optimistic time and foreign investment might be elevated and other currencies might do pretty well because in this spot the what drives the US dollar higher is a lot of times it's rising interest rates and a red-hot economy so in this case the US dollar is not really necessarily like full on bearish but it's definitely not full-on bullish so I'd say it's closer to bearish during this category and so is gold because gold typically does well in fearful environments or in highly inflationary environments so both of those situations are not the case here in The Sweet Spot because during The Sweet Spot we're seeing things uh kind of normalized and doing very well overall and gold typically doesn't do well in confident Market environments usually uh that's that's there's a little there should be a little asterisk next to that because it's not perfect science with any of this stuff there's other factors than just inflation for sure this is just kind of a lens of inflation to consider in your toolbox finally hot inflation hot inflation is pretty much just bullish for the US dollar if you take a look at the 2022 year the dollar just screamed higher all year long and it was because interest rates were going up and up and up because inflation was going up and up and up and the Fed was trying to combat that rise in inflation by raising the interest rates in the United States so the point is US dollar typically does very good during that time on the bearish side pretty much everything stocks don't look so great like they didn't look great in 2022. non-usd currencies like the Euro the pound everything against the dollar typically will fall in a very hot inflation area where the FED is is you know on the door knocking and raising rates those things are going to put a lot of pressure on the dollar to the upside and of course that means other currencies may do less well and finally bonds typically don't do well because Rising interest rates make current bonds or old bonds previously issued bonds less attractive to investors because why buy a bond at two percent when it looks like interest rates are going to go up to three percent I might just wait and buy a bond once interest rates get much higher so that's why bonds can be a very important Market as well we've probably got another video coming on bonds lots of stuff here so make sure to subscribe if you have not already okay guys so I wanted to show you something on the edge finder which is our team's Market data software where we can take a look at some inflation figures and what you'll notice is that there's all sorts of different major economies and their respective inflation here reported and if you take a look at the blue line that's going to be our US dollar uh related inflation so of course when it comes to inflation we've been we saw a very high spike in inflation during 20 22 and in 2023 we saw a decline in inflation well one thing when it comes to scoring and adding in inflation to my trading strategy is I want to take into account what is going on with particular currencies in our top setups algorithm so if you're not familiar with the edge finder what this tool does is it takes into account tons of different Market data specifically to this video talking about inflation the edge finder automatically pulls in the latest inflation statistics and then what it does is it actually scores and ranks all the different assets on the far left so one thing that we often hear from people who are using our tools are you know they want to use fundamentals in their trading like you know growth and inflation and unemployment and interest rates and use all that information to better their trading but it's a lot of work to keep up with and to check all this stuff so the edge finder does a pretty cool thing it takes into account all of this data and it pretty much ranks and files things for you so every everything that we're talking about in this video is pretty much accounted for the way I explained it is accounted for in the edge finder where it takes into account inflation as well as many other key metrics scores the totals and gives us biases so one thing that you'll notice here is that when we're looking at the euro versus the dollar the pound versus the dollar what we're seeing is recently the inflation in the United States has spiked back up again pointing towards a bullish reading on the dollar now remember as we've gone in this video so far uh talking about inflation Rising is bullish for the currency because the Central Bank may be more likely to act and so we're getting certain readings and part of that waiting is coming directly from our inflation study that we're talking about so you can directly see how the lessons that we're discussing in this video are in in fact certainly being reflected in the scoring algorithm from the edge finder which is for me personally where I find the trades that I am taking so inflation as well as other things are playing a serious waiting into which trades I am actually looking to take on what particular assets for example right now at the time of recording this we know inflation is ticking up well that inflation reading uh is pointing towards a slightly more bearish reading for gold as the dollar may become more attractive and put downward pressure on the gold market if you'd like access to the edge finder again you can find more information Down Below in the description so now that you guys have seen a little bit of our software tool that we use to calculate and monitor inflation automatically I want to tell you

ENDEVR,1.0,Sg2Xqd8kx_U,while the world comes out of economic recession due to the pandemic a lot of things are changing high inflation stimulus packages interest rates all these words are popping up on the news but it's hard to figure out how does the whole system work in this video we explain all of that and more let's start with hyperinflation inflation is the rate that shows how much the price for goods and services rise a low inflation rate is the norm in most countries around the world the u.s inflation rate for example in 2019 was 2.3 percent in the euro zone 1.3 percent the american economist philip kagan was the first to classify hyper inflation he stated that the phenomenon happens when a country's inflation rate exceeds 50 percent per month there are different reasons this happens even though each case is unique there are common patterns for example in most cases the economy is already weak and there is a shock caused by war international isolation or natural disasters the road to hyperinflation usually comes after a chain of events and it usually happens as follows tax revenues are drastically reduced the reason can be external factors like war a sudden change in commodities prices or country specific reasons like political transition bad monetary policies and even corruption the government starts printing money the supply of money pushes inflation up the rise impacts government revenues the country experiences a period of high inflation affecting the government's budget and confidence in its institutions the government then prints more money and resorts to measures that fail to control inflation the inflation rate accelerates the currency value collapses inflation explodes country experiences hyperinflation before the first world war cases of hyperinflation were rare prices rose during the french revolution and american civil war but hyperinflation is mostly a modern phenomenon the following ranking was created by economists steve hankey and nicholas cruz so here we go let's see which countries produce the five worst cases of hyperinflation in the last 100 years number five greece this is greece the country that gave us democracy philosophers and probably the world's earliest currency units the drachma it is also the country that experienced the fifth worst case of hyperinflation in history the worst month was october 1944 when the inflation rate was 13 800 percent the new york times reported that month that one dollar was worth 300 million drachmas in the port of patras to understand how the situation got that bad it is important to go back four years the country was occupied by the axis forces during the second world war the new government added to its expenses the support of its army which had approximately four hundred thousand soldiers this expense represented between one-third to three-fifths of all the country's expenditures during that time and notes advanced from the greek bank paid the bill when the occupation ended tax revenues covered only six percent of total expenditures another point of instability that contributed to the hyperinflation was the government's policy of paying with gold sovereigns a british gold coin this reduced public trust in the economy and added uncertainty to the situation in 1940 a british gold coin could be exchanged for 1100 drachma by december 1944 it could be exchanged for 19.9 trillion drachma in october 1944 the exiled greek government returned and implemented plans to curtail inflation the country continued to be plagued with political instability internal conflicts and other difficulties post-war greece was marked by other inflationary periods the country joined the european union in 1981 and adopted the euro in 2001 since then inflation remains under control number 4 germany one of the most famous hyperinflation periods in history happened in germany during the weimar republic events took a dramatic turn in october 1923 when wholesale prices increased by 29 500 percent a loaf of bread in 1922 cost 163 marks by september 1923 the price had increased to 1.5 billion in november it was 200 billion the situation got so extreme that people were paid out at an hourly basis workers rushed to stores to secure food and produce before prices soared again the prices doubled every 3.7 days on average it was normal to see people carrying money in wheelbarrows restaurants stopped displaying menus it was pointless by the time a person finished eating prices had gone up salaries and pensions lost their value fast a university teacher an esteemed position in society that came with a respectable salary could no longer feed his family a combination of factors led to this nightmare after the first world war the country had to shoulder the blame for starting the conflict pay exorbitant reparations relinquish control of colonies and territories and limit the size of its army all of this would already be a source of destabilization but there was more germany had used bonds to fund the war the plan was to conquer territories and pay the debt back with the conquered money but in reality the new republic was created already with a colossal debt resulting from pre-war bonds some economists estimate that it was probably around 175 percent of the gdp with no option of a bailout quite the opposite germany needed to pay reparations to the other countries in hard currency the government then started printing money to pay its debt and to buy foreign currency the more it printed the more the currency tanked and inflation rose people realized money had lost its value and rushed to spend this created a vicious circle in 1914 a dollar was valued at around 4.2 marks by november 1923 the exchange rate for a single us dollar was 4.2 trillion marks the situation was stabilized somewhat by a new currency backed with hard assets in 1924 but by then millions of middle-class germans had lost their savings this period was so traumatic that some people say to this day it still haunts the public and continues to be an influential factor in the country's debt aversion number three yugoslavia taking third place on the podium the bronze medal goes to the federal republic of yugoslavia in the first month of 1994 the inflation rate rose 313 million percent during this time you would be able to buy a loaf of bread with a 500 million dinar note that's it just one the situation got so crazy that the cost of a pack of cigarettes in the morning would be the equivalent of one cigarette in the evening the money value was so high that the government kept introducing new plans to cut the zeros it didn't work the situation continued to deteriorate on january 1st 1994 the government knocked nine zeros off the notes with a monetary plan by the last week of the same month it had already printed a 10 million dinar note to understand how this happened we need to look at the disintegration of the former socialist republic of yugoslavia from june 1991 to march 1992 slovenia croatia macedonia and bosnia-herzegovina declared independence the remaining two countries serbia and montenegro formed what was called the federal republic of yugoslavia the war that followed independence led to international sanctions which include a trade embargo the country relied heavily on imports and the effects of sanctions had a huge impact on the economy the country had four regional central banks in addition to the official one all of them some of them illegally conducted credit provisions and issued dinar notes without oversight the newly formed federal republic had also two outside republics formed by ethnic serbian majorities republica srpska in bosnian herzegovina and the republic of serbian cryina in croatia these two republics also went through hyperinflation periods with similar magnitude the republican serbsca for example had an inflation rate of 297 million percent in january 1994. later in 1994 the government created a new monetary plan with a new currency backed by the german mark after that inflation decreased to double-digit levels in annual terms which persisted for years following montenegro's independence in 2006 the country ceased to exist number 2. zimbabwe the silver medal goes to the most recent case on our list zimbabwe the african country had the world's second highest inflation in the first of the 21st century in november 2008 the prices increased 79.6 billion percent a bag of sugar cost about 90 billion zimbabwe dollars and salaries of unskilled workers were around 200 billion that was the equivalent of 10 a month 150 billion zimbabwean dollars got you 20 eggs and an average retirement pension paid out 130 billion which at one point was worth less than one dollar to understand what led to this we need to understand history after years of fighting between the white regime and black nationalists zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 robert mugabe emerged as a national leader and was able to consolidate his powers during his government he moved toward an authoritarian regime of one party rule and joined the first congo war in 1990 and the second in 1998. in 2000 he promoted the fast track land reform program which seized wide-owned land without any compensation ignoring a former joint effort with the british government to make that possible the central bank started lending directly to new farmers to finance the operations this led to farmers being replaced by inexperienced sometimes first-time landowners together with the impact of severe droughts agricultural production and exports declined significantly as a result the economy stagnated food shortages and riots started to take place the involvement in the wars and accusations of human rights violations raised international criticism and the country became increasingly isolated all the uncertainty had a profound effect on the foreign investments which fell from 400 million dollars in 1998 to 30 million dollars in 2007 since its independence there was no year that the government had a balanced budget and never a surplus when inflation accelerated the government tried measures like redenomination of the currency limiting on money withdrawal and a price freeze hyperinflation followed and the population moved to foreign currencies which exacerbated the situation in 2009 the country created a multi-currency dollarization system that replaced the zimbabwe dollar although it calmed the situation for a while until today even after mugabe's deposition via a coup in 2017 there are still reports that the inflation rate is above 50 percent in the country number one hungary hungary experienced after the second world war what is to this day the world record in inflation the country had an inflation rate of 4.19 quadrillion percent in july 1946 historians recall that the famous hungarian poet george falooti was paid 300 billion pego by his publisher with the money he was able to buy one chicken one liter of olive oil and a few vegetables at a local budapest market during this time prices were doubling every 15 hours with such high inflation people started to rely on the black market the desperation of the government was so big that it imposed the death penalty for dealings in black market trade in 1945 a note with a face value of 100 quintillion pego was issued until today no banknote with a higher denomination was ever issued the roots of this nightmare are in the war damage lack of reserves reparations costs of occupation among other reasons after the war the situation was catastrophic in total economists estimate that 40 percent of hungary's non-human wealth was destroyed this had a huge effect on the production capacity and put pressure on prices the soviets signed the armistice with hungary and set reparation costs at 300 million dollars which included the removal of equipment the hungarians also had to pay for soviet troops stationed in the country according to estimates hungary's after war bill was between 600 and 900 million dollars with a huge deficit and isolated hungary had no other option than printing money it printed so much that currency circulation passed from 25 billion pango in july 1945 to 1.6 trillion by january 1946 reached 65 quadrillion by may and 47 septillion pango by july 1946 in 1947 the hungarian government announced a reform created a new currency and stipulated rules such as new central bank regulations to government loans prices started falling and went back to normal in the following months as we saw hyperinflation happens when a government loses control of its economy next we will see how the system works and how is this possible since officially abandoning the gold standard in 1973 the dollar is what economists call fiat money the word fiat comes from latin and is often translated as a decree but in summary the term means that the money is not backed by a physical asset like gold or silver pretty much every currency in the world is fiat money and their value fluctuates in relation to each other having a currency with no backing makes it easier to control the supply of money for example this is helpful in moments of crisis and recession when the government's resort to measures to inject money and revive the economy where there's an upside there are also downsides some see this as the disadvantages of the system to understand both sides of this problem let's take a closer look at where the trillions of dollars that are part of corona relief packages come from to afford this amount of money the government needs to increase its debts dramatically one of the ways of doing that is issuing bonds government bonds are debt securities an instrument used to raise money and support spending obligations bonds are basically a document in which a lender like a bank agrees to lend money to the government and in return the debt can be repaid at a later date with interest depending on the country the bonds are issued in they vary on interest rates and dates that need to be repaid in the case of the united states the treasury department sells the issued bonds during auctions throughout the year issuing bonds is a standard procedure in normal circumstances there is a market to absorb the bonds without a big fuss but when we are talking about sudden trillions of dollars things are not that simple and the role played by the federal reserve also known as fed is what makes things controversial in theory the fed is independent and its main goal is to promote maximum employment stable prices and manage long-term interest rates in the united states but in extraordinary cases such as the relief packages the fed also functions as a buyer buying most of the government bonds issued in the first corona relief package during donald trump's presidency the fed signaled its willingness to essentially buy an unlimited amount of government debt the fed is not allowed to buy bonds directly from the government it needs to buy on what is called open market operations it can be bought from the so-called primary dealers this includes the big banks and brokers like jp morgan goldman sachs and others for example once the fed buys the equivalent of one trillion dollars in bonds from these institutions it injects the same amount of money into the bank reserves facilitates lending and increases the money supply and circulation it's direct money being injected into the economy money that didn't exist until the fed bought the bonds moreover the fed is no ordinary bond holder by law it has to pay its profits to the treasury at the end of the day when the treasury pays interest on bonds this money generated by bonds that becomes a profit goes back to the government at the same time that the fed acts on open market operations it also cuts its benchmark interest rate reducing the cost of borrowing when businesses and people borrow more it also increases the amount of money in circulation for the critics these measures to stimulate the economy are just loopholes in the system an unofficial way of an endless supply of money without actually printing it there is risk to long-term stability and can lead to inflation devaluation of the dollar and eventually collapse of the economy but is the fed over stimulating the economy with open market operations to understand the situation it's possible to look into the fed's balance sheet which consists of assets like bonds and liabilities owned by the bank the total amount went from 4.1 trillion dollars in the last week of february 2020 to 7.5 trillion in the first week of february 2021 not all of these are government bonds but this number gives us an idea of how much the fed has been acting during this crisis since the dollar is fiat money there are no limits to issue debt and also no limits for the fed to act and buy the bonds supplying the government with more money and more dollars available can also affect its value if the united states had a currency backed by something the fed would not be able to expand the money supply to such an excessive amount for example if the fed tried to do that while on the gold standard it would cause the dollar value to fall due to oversupply compared to its gold parity and compromise the basis of the system for the pessimists this is putting us on a trajectory of crisis and the collapse is inevitable so again in a nutshell this is how the cycle of collapse would work everything starts with the currency backed by a physical asset in the dollar case until 1973 it was gold the precious mineral gave value to currency and created a level of confidence that led to the expansion of commerce and credit but with the currency attached to gold there is a limit on how much credit is possible to generate plus the system is affected by the amount of gold mined in the world and very exposed to speculation as the country needs to always keep currency value in parity with the gold reserves this limitation led to the idea that gold backing the dollar was not beneficial the country then leaves the system the fiat model comes in through a decree remember what fiat means what follows is euphoria the system is flooded with liquidity stimulus packages increasing spending in many areas increase in trade this leads to abuse government starts spending more than it should and monetizes even more of its debts to fund its obligations slowly the economic growth starts to decline and confidence starts to fade inflation begins rising all confidence is lost hyperinflation follows and the economy collapses a new government creates a new system with a new currency backed by a physical asset the cycle begins anew critics believe we are at a stage where the government is starting to lose its confidence inflation inevitably will start to rise and be followed by hyperinflation and collapse but is there any truth behind this pessimist view well there isn't a consensus but it's fair to say that the majority of economists would disagree with the forecast one of the most critical of these views is nobel prize laureate and new york times columnist paul krugman as proof that pessimism is unfounded he points to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis from the start of the economic crisis until 2014 the fed's balance sheet also grew exponentially more than four trillion dollars and still inflation stayed low krugman believes that the risks aren't greater now he believes that for the most part the funds that the fed injected into the economy simply piled up either in the bank reserves or in cash held by individuals and are not harmful the fed's latest bond buying spree is an evolution of what began finding acceptance considered normal during the 2008 financial crisis ben bernanke former chair of the fed during that time also hit back at the critics for him what the fed was doing wasn't printing money to finance government borrowing but a temporary measure that would be reversed eventually the fed sells the bonds it acquired and things go back to normal although they believe the practice isn't harmful to the economy long term it's important to point out the growing level of debt in the united states according to the congressional budget office 2020 was the first year since 1946 that the country's debt exceeded the size of the entire economy the u.s had a total debt held by the public of 21 trillion the equivalent of 100.1 percent of gdp by 2021 the country is projected to hold 22.4 trillion dollars in debt 102.3 percent of gdp they also project that the debt will represent 107 percent of gdp by 2031 when it should surpass 35.3 trillion dollars does that mean that there is no way out of the crisis and a collapse is about to happen it's impossible to predict but generally speaking there are no signs that the financial market is worried about the growing deficit the fact is despite the huge debt the u.s government is not financially constrained it has no problem borrowing money in borrowing is very cheap with the 10-year interest rate barely above one percent funnily enough the market sees this as a positive sign and the country would be able to keep going and borrowing forever under the current circumstances moreover with expected 3.7 percent gdp growth in the next decade any debt would tend to melt away as a share of gdp over time for now it seems like the full faith and credit of the united states is more than enough for investors we will have to wait and see for how long how would the economy be if we still have the gold standard would we be better or worse off let's take a look every once in a while the gold standard goes back into fashion the world has moved on from currencies attached to the precious metal for fifty years but discussions around the topic are more vivid than ever to understand why going back to the gold standard is still appealing to some people we need to dive into what are the disadvantages and advantages of the system the biggest argument pro gold standard has to do with safety and stability one can argue that gold retains a stable value to the currency and this theoretically could reduce the risk of instability and economic crises with a fixed asset backing the money's value governments wouldn't be able to raise their debts without first buying more gold for some people especially those who worry about hyper inflation and do not trust governments or central banks the gold standard is a great tool to legally curb government spending and the money supply into society according to this thought with the currency attached to limited physical assets like gold the risks of debt spiraling out of control followed by inflationary periods are smaller and long-term stability safety and prosperity would follow supporters of the gold standard believe that the system does not allow the government to resort to expansionary measures as it seems fit or what critics usually say simply print more money to finance new debt and let's be honest the us debt problem is getting bigger by the day at the end of 2020 the us government debt held by the public was at more than 21 trillion dollars a little bit more than the whole gdp as a comparison that's much more than what the country owns in gold the u.s gold reserves were valued at 11 trillion dollars by the end of 2020 if we look at the historical graph of united states debt since 1966 we can clearly see a path look at it here that's when the country left the gold standard now check what happened next some believe that if the united states continues down this path the result will inevitably be a severe crisis in the years to come and the solution for that might rest on going back to the gold standard but for some things are not as simple as gold standard defenders believe no one disagrees that the u s fiscal situation is challenging but having the currency tied to gold would change some of the most basic fundamentals of the current monetary policy in the ongoing system the federal reserve can respond to financial crises in many ways among many measures it can lower interest rates during a recession raise the rates during an inflationary period or it can buy or sell government bonds and inject money into the economy when necessary and this flexibility to act according to the situation was very important in the last decade during the 2008 financial crash or 2020 covet crisis the fed has resorted to expansionary measures in both cases if the currency were still pegged to gold the fed's actions would be limited and one can only imagine both the social and economic impacts that might have incurred on the gold standard system the focus of any monetary policy would be diverted away from ensuring economic stability to maintaining an exchange rate target with gold being the most important aspect of the economy the country's need to keep its reserves intact becomes the focal point of the central banks more than providing an ideal business scenario fighting unemployment or raising productivity also making exchange rate adjustments would be more difficult and the government would have to resort to alternatives like protectionist measures higher tariffs import quotas or exchange control the results of this could harm economies around the world and affect global trade another negative aspect of the gold standard that is not very often discussed would be environmental damage gold is a scarce mineral increased demand for gold would mean that mining activity would also increase very often on indigenous lands around the world the impacts of this could be devastating okay back to the question of how the economy would look like when we still have the dollar pegged to gold three economists have a possible answer to this question through a quantitative method they calculate how the u s economy would have performed if the dollar was still pegged to the gold between two thousand and twenty twenty the results are not very good for the gold standard advocates for example the researchers found that the shocks on gold supply and demand would have a greater negative effect on the economy than any other shocks that have happened such as an economic crisis if the gold standard was still in place during this period we would have an increase in economic volatilities and a deterioration of the household welfare basically the speed at which gold is mined introduces a lot of randomness to monetary policy the fed would have to set interest rates to maintain a fixed dollar price of gold rather than to target inflation as it is today for example in moments of crisis people spend less and investors purchase more gold a safe haven investment in this case the central bank would have to increase the interest rate to make other assets more attractive and control the price of the mineral if the reverse happens and for some reason there is more gold in the world the central bank would have to lower the interest rate in the end the monetary decision would not be rational or based on facts and estimations but more a matter of faith or a belief on what could happen to the gold situation in the world in summary an economy based on how much gold is mined around the world would be let's say probably more unstable but is it even reasonable to consider a transition back to gold standard well it depends who you ask for some it would be a big mess but not impossible for starters the united states would not be able to go back to the gold standard alone due to trade and money supply it would be very complicated for the us to do this alone otherwise countries that own large chunks of u.s debt like china for example could just ask for their dollars to be exchanged for gold in theory that would not be a problem but and that's a big but if every debt holder does the same the us probably won't have enough gold in its reserve to pay it all back yes the numbers don't match so if it wants to go down this path the us would have to pump its gold reserves or the gold price would have to be set so high and the dollar would be so devalued that inflation would follow and trade would possibly crash that's the scenario that critics of the gold standard believed to happen if an attempt to go back would take place but defenders do not agree with that in the end the gold standard is not as unusual as some people want to believe it's just a fixed valued system according to the imf many countries around the world have their currencies somehow linked to an external standard typically the euro or the dollar for a country going back to the gold standard would be more of the same and not that crazy and if these views were once restricted to the fringes it really made it to the mainstream in the last years the republican party called for a commission to investigate the viability of going back to the gold standard on the campaign platforms of 2012 and 2016 a bill to establish a commission to look into the feasibility of the gold standard was approved in the house of representatives in 2015 and 2017 but never managed to get approved in the senate alexander mooney a representative from west virginia even proposed the full-on return to the gold standard on a bill that never got co-sponsors and never happened in 2020 when then president donald trump appointed judy shelton a longtime gold standard advocate to a seat on the federal reserve's board of governors everyone thought that shelton would finally get to the front seat of monetary policy makers the nomination got stuck in the senate and never happened but shelton's ideas were put under the spotlight in the past she had called for a new bretton woods conference referencing the 1944 meeting that established the post-war economic order to understand exactly what a new bretton woods would mean today we need to go back in time and look into the origins of the first one the road to breton woods was paved by policies and choices from way before the conference in 1900 the gold standard act made the policy official in the united states the gold dollar was then declared the standard unit and all forms of money issued by the government were to be maintained at parity with it after the first world war countries started experimenting leaving the gold standard and printing more money to save their economies the united states kept the gold standard after the crash of 29 investors started trading commodities in currencies looking for safer investments and the price of gold rose a hoarding phenomenon spread in the united states affecting the country's gold reserves in 1933 u s president franklin delano roosevelt issued an executive order for bidding hoarding and the gold reserve act was signed in 1934 with the forbidding people were allowed to keep just the equivalent of one hundred dollars and everything else needed to be returned to the state the gold reserve act would lead to the creation of the reserves at fort knox in 1936 the legendary u.s gold depository in kentucky where 143 million ounces of gold are kept at the moment fast forward to the last year of the second world war representatives of 44 countries gathered in july 1944 in breton woods a resort place in new hampshire to organize what would be the post-war monetary system it was also in the same event that the ideas of the international monetary fund and the world bank initially focused only on reconstruction were forged the americans arrived at bretton woods in a very strong position with reserves of 20 000 metric tons of gold roughly 60 percent of the world's total they advocated for fixed conversion rates assured by a dollar tied to gold the brits heavily in debt and broke after the war were hoping for flexible exchange rates to revive exports but the americans feared post-war inflation in the end the americans had their way after the agreement the countries were to keep their currencies fixed but adjustable to the dollar which was pegged to gold at 35 an ounce it was only by 1959 however that the system started operating as agreed in bretton woods up to this point countries maintained fixed exchange rates in relation to the dollar by buying their currency in exchange markets when too low or increasing the supply of money when too high during the sixties a surplus of dollars caused by foreign aid military spending due to the vietnam war and foreign investment made it almost impossible for the united states to keep the value of the gold at 35 presidents tried to control the gold price with actions like restrictions on foreign lending this resulted in the nation's foreign trading position being damaged for the overvalued dollar in 1971 then president richard nixon announced that the united states would no longer buy gold to maintain the price at thirty five dollars and halted the convertibility which meant that countries could no longer redeem dollars
KINGCADEMY,1.0,ZLv636OxgL4,hey everyone with all the talk of inflation in the news i thought it would be prudent to do a quick video on a common measure of inflation namely the consumer price index or cpi but first what is inflation inflation is where the general prices of goods and services increase deflation on the other hand is when they decreased for instance due to inflation the price of a loaf of bread in the uk in 1975 was 16p in 2021 it is around 160. as prices rise this means that the currency's purchasing power decreases using the same example 106 p nowadays could buy you six and a half loaves of bread back in 1975 whereas now it can only get you one so why does this happen well it happens because the price of raw materials production and salaries to make and sell that loaf of bread rise over time inflation can also happen as the demand for certain goods rise more demand than supply means an increase in the price of supply now people politicians economics need a way to quantify and measure this rate of inflation and as such have developed ways to do this so let's talk about cpi one of the common measures cpi is a theoretical basket of everyday goods each with an average price tag now there are hundreds of everyday goods and services that are tracked and they are split into eight categories namely housing clothing transport food and drink medical care recreation education and other examples within these categories might include the price of a carton of milk a loaf of bread rent a pair of shoes electricity and so on these also depend what country you are from the basket of goods in the uk will be different from the basket of goods in the us and this basket is also dependent on the times in which we live for example in 2020 hand sanitizer was added to this list cpi is always measured against a base year so if the average cost of a basket in 2021 is 5 pound 20 and the average cost of that same basket in 2020 is 5 pound ten the increase is five pound twenty divided by five pound ten times a hundred which is one point zero one nine or simply one one point nine percent rise cpi helps determine the purchasing power of a currency and consequently the rate of inflation the government here in the uk aims to keep inflation at the two percent level the general view is that if inflation is too high or changes a lot it's hard for businesses to set the right prices for their products and for people to plan their spending on the other hand if it is too low then people might not spend as much as they expect prices to fall which stops the economy from growing having said that the reason why everyone is talking about it now is that inflation in the uk is now as high as 5.1 percent now when we talk in terms of loaves of bread it's hard to see how a five percent rise in prices is impactful in the everyday however it really is and is something everyone needs to take seriously let's take a broad example say in 2021 you receive a net salary of 30 000 pounds a year and your cost of living bills rent car etc comes to around twenty thousand pounds a year so you manage to put ten thousand pounds away in savings on a five percent inflation rate your cost of living in one year's time in 2022 will essentially be 21 000 pounds now if your salary doesn't go up accordingly to match inflation then now you're only saving 9 000 pounds a year and this goes on and on so why is inflation so high at the moment well there are a number of reasons but it's mostly due to the global pandemic energy price increases and the varying supply supply chain disruption leading to less supply than demand as a whole which puts upward pressure on the prices so what has the government done well in order to try and lessen the effects of inflation two days ago the bank of england decided to raise interest rates to 0.25 from its all-time low of 0.1 percent so what does this do generally interest rates and inflation rates have an inverse relationship if interest rates are low more people can borrow money to spend the economy grows and inflation increases if interest rates are high people tend to save more because returns from savings are greater this means they don't spend as much the economy slows and inflation decreases so a higher interest rate basically is trying to decrease the demand of the demand supply relationship which we spoke about before i hope that makes sense it is important to note that cpi is not the only measure of inflation in the uk we also have an adjustment cpi known as cpih which includes home occupies housing costs this means the theoretical basket includes all the costs associated with owning maintaining and living in one's own home there is also an older measure of inflation called the retail price index as as well as the wholesale price index but i'll perhaps go into those in other videos i hope this gives you a starting overview of cpi inflation and interest rates if you enjoyed this video please do subscribe to my channel and comment below if you have any thoughts take care everyone i'll see you all soon [Music]
Forrest Hoffman,1.0,DFCslu5jVKo,let's get into the tokenomics of seoul the native token to the solana blockchain tokenomics and cryptocurrency is extremely important well let's look at the supply let's look at different inflation rates let's look at what's going on knowing these things understanding when you're investing in cryptocurrency is extremely important this is not financial advice do not take any of my advice when investing in cryptocurrencies this is just for information educational purposes only let's uh get right into this so here we're on coin gecko and we have our circulating supply and we have our total supply what's interesting with solana is there are quite a few blockchains that have max supplies and then there's the circulating supply uh however with solana there is technically no max supply so the inflation can happen and definitely i'm gonna go over the inflation rates and what that's looking like but it is interesting because there is kind of two different inflation rates now looking at circulating supply that is going to be all the tokens that are actually on the that are on the blockchain that are able to be traded and used and staked and all these things the total supply is this number that is quite vague so let's look more at the solana tokenomics this uh graph here you've probably already seen and this is actually a big point that people who do not like seoul uh look at this allocation of solana of seoul tokens and as you can see a lot of the tokens went to foundations seed sales investors the team not as many went out into the retail market and to investors like you and me which makes people say that seoul seems more centralized and less decentralized which is quite true probably is more centralized but anyways so we had 20 to the foundation 25 of the seed sale 20 to the uh founding sale strategic sale 3 to strategic sale 8.2 to validator sale public auction sale was only 2.6 so that is very low if we look here at the initial token distribution of seoul so there is this chart here of the sole supply schedule it gives you an idea here from december 20th this is basically when all the tokens were issued these are all the different amounts here this is all basically the uh what you would call the centralized group of holders here and then this green part here is going to be your staking rewards inflation and says by november 32 we're gonna have a this is the total supply this doesn't necessarily mean the total circulation of solana which i think to me the circulating amount is more important because that's actually what is being traded and bought and sold and such so here it's stating by november 2032 we will have 800 million total supply of sold these here were your funding rounds 3.17 million was raised in a seed 2018 at 40 cents uh 12 million was raised at 20 cents another 5 million was raised at 22 cents back in 2019 1.8 million was raised in 2020 for 22 cents so these early investors got in extremely early and if you've been in seoul for a little bit you saw the pump last year up to the high 200s they made crazy crazy crazy returns if they sold if they sold we don't know for sure now what is something that's good to know is i wanted to see when these tokens were able to be sold or dumped on the open market to see if there is a date that we might be waiting for that the supply could spike now from uh masari.io most of the information here is stating around january 7 2021 the majority of these pre-seed these seed sales these investor sales became unlocked so those have already been unlocked and have been able to be sold on the market how much those were sold we don't necessarily know there's a 12.5 percent here that was issued to founders allocation this won't be fully unlocked and vested until january 2023 but it will be vested monthly so they can sell increments of this sole on the open market now there was a grant pool you have 35 million community reserve tokens uh in 5 million token increments this was unlocked january 2021. so it looks like the majority of these early investors have been able to sell since january of 2021 so that date has already passed uh how much they still hold we don't know for sure but this is good to look at now the thing that i wanted to look into is the inflation inflation to me is extremely important when investing in currencies and the us dollar has crazy inflation right now and a lot of these crypto currencies especially the proof of stake have inflation when you look up salon inflations these are the quick numbers you find the initial inflation rate is eight percent the disinflation rate is 15 so supposedly the inflation is supposed to decrease by 15 every single year until we get to the long-term inflation rate of 1.5 percent annually with no max now that is the inflation rate of the total supply that is not the inflation of the circulating supply so let's go over this uh proposed inflation schedule this will vary based on the amount of solana that is locked or staked on the network so annual inflation this date here is as of january 20 or sorry january 25 2020 and this will be this will show each year the inflation rate of the total supply of solana will decrease over a 10-year period where 10 years so that would be 2030 we'll have a total supply inflation of 1.5 percent this is going to be the number of total supply so we basically started out at 500 million uh total supply of solana and in 15 years we'll be up at 750 million total solana tokens now if we look here at example staked yield so see if you look at this graph here it shows you how there's an annual staking yield percentage and that's either more or less depending on how much is staked for soul so say only sixty percent of soul is staked you're going to have a 13 annual yield if 90 percent of soul of staked you're going to have an 8 annual yield however most uh staking wallets you'll see last time i checked we were getting about six percent on solano so you want to be staking your solana to help combat a bit with this inflation and then you'll see here after 10 years that the supply inflation will hit this 1.5 percent right here so this chart here is showing you the this chart goes over the inflation of the total supply of solana i made a video about the inflation and tokenomics of kadena i also like that project as well i'll link it in my description you can check it out one of the uh one of my followers talked about comparing it to the inflation of solana um and you know it seems like cryptocurrency is very campy everyone's camp team solana team kadena team cardano i don't prescribe to really any of this uh i think there is a lot of unknowns uncertainties in this space i like to diversify my portfolio amongst a bunch of different projects that i see the potential of there being growth and seeing who wins i don't like to be all in on one thing and necessarily trash one thing seems like the narratives switch a lot so that's kind of my approach to this and i am a holder of solana i'm also a holder of kadena i'm also a holder of cardano i'm also a holder of avalanche so when i'm making videos about these things it doesn't necessarily mean this is the only thing i believe in i see people talking about videos of someone bashing kadena and like oh he's a solana holder and all this and you know i i don't know there's bad things about solana there's bad things about cadena there's bad things about avalanche there's good things about avalanche and solana and ethereum and and there are pluses and minuses to all these projects you have to figure out what makes sense with your investing um strategy now this chart here by masari.io to me is very important this is over the five year period this blue part is our circulating supply of soul the gray line here this is our price action now it would make sense that um you know when there was actually if you look at this the price of seoul isn't necessarily yes right now it looks like oh yeah the circulating supply has gone up the price is down that makes sense there's more supply but really this is a demand situation the demand has just decreased a lot there was a ton of demand here for solana there's less demand here yes there is more uh cir the supply has gone up but is not a direct correlation the the circulating supply of soil sold does not directly correlate between the price action or else this gray line would be generally following this downwards like this right if if they were directly correlated you'd have a much smoother uh you'd have a higher nu you'd have a higher original price here and it would kind of come down because there would be that would be saying there's equal demand basically and i kind of have referenced this in comments in my other videos that the the supply the inflation these things is really important but so much that drives these coins is demand and or the price action of these coins is demand and whatever that may be whether it's a narrative whether it's the actual tech whether it's user bases tvl uh all these different things they all come into play when valuating in the market of a uh cryptocurrency so this is the circulating supply of soul and this is the actual amount that is out there being traded now this information here is quite important says the circulating supply acknowledges that tokens may be held by projects foundations which have no intent to sell down their positions but which have not locked up supply in a formal contract thus circulating supply does not include known project treasury holdings which can be significant note that an investor may must carefully consider both liquid and circulating supplies when evaluating an asset the two can be very significantly a risk depending entirely on circulating supply is that the number can change dramatically based on discretionary sale from project treasury so they're saying there is a possibility that there are other coins that are kind of circulating but or that are out there but they're not necessarily being traded at this very time but they could come onto the market and anyways but the number to me that is extremely important when i'm looking at this so this is the five-year chart we can look at the one-year chart here now this does look like there is a direct correlation but basically this is just the bull run ending moving into a bear market and the supply is still going up this is mainly going to be from staking emissions but look here i want to put in the date today is september 7th 2022 so a year ago we had 292 million in circulating supply today we have 349 million we've had a 20 increase of circulating supply so even though the total supply has this annual inflation of eight percent uh we have a circulating supply inflation of 20 that is uh quite a bit of supply but as i or that is quite a bit of inflation but as i showed earlier that the price doesn't necessarily directly correlate to the amount of inflation so when this bear market ends and the bull market comes back can salon a pump and can the demand outweigh the inflation and bring up the price absolutely is there more circulating um sole tokens than there was back during the last bull market so we can look here uh during the last peak peak of the bull market we had 302 million solana tokens so let's actually look at what the inflation has been since that date let's go back to november 8th so if you look here we have had an increase in circulation since the last peak of the price of solana of 16 now if it was directly correlated the price would have only dropped by 16 percent but obviously as you can see that's not the case it's dropped by like 80 to 90 and it's dropped by a crazy amount but that's cryptocurrencies it's unregulated there's a lot of retail money uh there's a lot of big players here that probably sold huge bags and made out with crazy crazy gains so that's just uh part of solana that's just part of cryptocurrency so this is uh interesting this isn't interesting to note as well it says ongoing emissions solana validators voted to enable pico inflation on december 24 2020 the sole supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1 percent guess from 2020 to 2021 there basically wasn't really any inflation to the total supply 0.1 percent and then uh they said the final inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation of 8 decreases 15 annually and down to a 1.5 percent of that total supply but as you can see here the uh annual circulating supply has been inflating by 20 uh which from a currency perspective is not good but this is cryptocurrency these prices move really fast uh this is um yeah so hopefully you enjoyed this quick breakdown of the tokenomics of solana if you did please like the video subscribe to my channel doesn't cost you anything especially a little like to the video or leave your comment leave it leave your thoughts uh tell me if you think i'm wrong tell me if you think i'm right i don't mind either way and uh yeah let's keep going whoo
LearningMole,1.0,3I81-P_lwvw,[Music] yesterday i went to the fun fair with my dad it was very fun and i learned something new let me tell you all about it we arrived at the fun fair and my favorite treat just appeared like magic right in front of me i scream [Music] i immediately put on my best convincing voice and said to my dad please dad said okay but just a small one dad went to pay he looked a bit shocked how much that has risen in price he shook his head and paid the money then i saw my favorite game and decided that my convincing voice had to reappear dad rolled his eyes but i knew he couldn't resist a convincing voice how much i want a teddy it was definitely my lucky day it was about to get luckier as i had spotted a balloon cellar please dad looked at his wallet it was almost empty but luckily the balloon seller said why accept all my decretic cards sir of course you do that exclaimed dad was a bit annoyed he didn't have any money left then he said a very strange thing i think your balloon isn't the only thing that's unfloated i was puzzled what do you mean dad dad said well when your balloon gets blown up it is inflated it gets bigger and bigger when the price of items get bigger or increased this is called inflation 2. i asked what sort of things and dad told me everything food toys clothes bikes you name it and the price of things change over time i didn't know that that sounds bad i said to that he said sometimes it is it can mean that things get more expensive and it's harder for some people to buy them it's bad for those who can't buy and for those people who produce things so if you make cars and the price of cars go up not many people will be able to buy your car oh no i exclaimed so you lose your money dad said not really your money loses value and the same amount of money will buy you less if inflation is seven percent your money would be worth seven percent less than it was before for example mom has a set budget to spend on grocery shopping every week but if some items go up in price she will get less items for her budget i wondered why it happened that explained that there were a few reasons why it can be because more people want to buy things which can lead to businesses having a limited amount of sale i thought hmm like when we were trying to buy my bike dad said yes i remember we had to try a few different types of bikes as the companies have risen their prices i remember one of the bikes you liked only had 10 available and 100 people wanted them then the price increased as the business knew they could get more money i asked but does that mean only those people who have more money can afford it dad said yes that's right he also said that the cost of making things can increase because the materials to make them may have also risen in cost he gave me an example my dad loves to tell a story example think of a loaf of bread the price might rise because the flour to make it is more expensive the gas to bake the bread and the fuel to transport the bread to the shops may have risen too ah now i understood but i had to ask the question if the price of items are inflating there's only one thing that hasn't my dad said what's that and i replied my pocket money [Music] you
Atrioc,1.0,qF4GepJrT9Y,i actually do without my inflation because inflation is kind of crazy bears you know i'm gonna i'm kind of you know what you can do you know i i want to talk about sort of the the situation we find ourselves in in uh most of the countries that you guys live in now okay here's the thing here's the deal and this is why it's probably good that we do this now when you hear the words inflation or you hear something like interest rates it's very easy for your brain to be like this i think a lot of times these terms are designed and obfuscated in a way to make it hard to focus harder so i'm gonna try and keep it as simple as possible but i also understand that we need to open with a round of let's just all say glizzy hands yep coke let's just get all that fun stuff out of the way all right we good are we good you might do you mind so here's the deal do any of you guys know you probably don't maybe you do the investor charlie munger yes no yes no no no all right he's warren buffett's business partner he's one of the best investors in history pretty old but he has one of the best track records in history he dropped this incredibly dire interview this is him on the right okay really and the stock market is is down a bit this year maybe because of inflation i want to ask you specifically about inflation are we looking at a prolonged decline in the markets because of inflation is inflation on the rise and should we be concerned about it well let me take that in the reverse order inflation is a very serious subject you can argue it's the way democracies die when democracy dies in latin america inflation is a big part of it so it's a huge danger once you've got a populist that learns it can vote itself money listen to that phrase though listen there's a lot of knowledge in this guy i know he's he's like a walking corpse i get it but let's plot some of the things he's saying number one this is how democracies die number two once a population learns they can vote themselves money okay that is key we're gonna say let's finish off this thing though if you look at the roman republic even after they went to a empire with an absolute ruler they inflated the currency steadily for hundreds of years and eventually the whole damn roman empire collapsed and then this guy tries to get into talking lighter news so the interviewer's like wow that's that's dark the collapse of society and so he goes is it something investors need to be worried about specifically when it comes to growth stocks right now those guys let's talk about [ __ ] zoom stock dude it's like what are you talking about hundreds of years of collapse i want to talk about it [ __ ] you know is facebook going up bro well i think the safe assumption for an investor is that over the next 100 years the currency's going to zero wow [Laughter] long paused in a while i love that charlie munger at age 98 is thinking in 100 year timelines this guy [ __ ] he wants to talk about anything else he wants to talk about anything else than charlie murray telling him the world's gonna collapse but uh okay look maybe he's a little too doom and gloom but i wanna i wanna talk about what he said here real quick which is basically that rampant inflation is one of the biggest causes of a societal unrest because any savings that the middle class has accumulated becomes rapidly worthless so let's take a look at this chart right here this chart right here is the amount of money this is about basically the amount of money that the government's printing and then right around the pandemic it spiked at a level never before seen and now it's at all time colossal crazy banana bears high let me back up a little bit so when the when the uh housing crisis 2007 when the great financial crisis happened we were set for a pretty big depression and what stopped it what stopped it was the government just printing a bunch of money basically doing massive bailouts flooding the market with with free money and it worked and unfortunate thing about that working is that we haven't stopped that strategy since and you know this happened slowly over time but since the pandemic it's been absolutely uh insane and so for the first year of it it's like everything's on crack and that's why we got [ __ ] nfts to the moon dogecoin going crazy housing prices skyrocketing but the hangover effects of that is that money starts to become less valuable per dollar that's inflation and so we're starting to get uh the highest recorded inflation ever it's it's happening like crazy uh now now i want to explain real quick so i i want to explain very simply basically when you hear interest rates like the government sets interest rates it's hard to figure out what that means or what's going on interest rates are based so imagine this is the federal reserve it's just a big pile of infinite money and the banks borrow from this and then loan the money out to you basically interest rates are the cost of borrowing money that's it and the government can set it by how much what they charge banks to borrow from them and if you want to juice the economy a little bit if things are rough let's say we have a big housing crisis what you can do is you can lower the interest rate when interest rates are high like if you have money sitting in a bank you'll get you'll get a lot of money if you're just sitting there but when they're low and borrowing money is easy then everyone starts borrowing money to do things like start businesses and hire employees and build factories and and so it juices your economy the problem is when interest rates are low you can't just stash your money in a bank and make money so you can see over the past you know 30 years the government has been continually lowering interest rates to try and juice the economy and then after 2008 they basically dropped them to zero money is essentially free to borrow so right about now is when it's starting to get because we did so much in the past year interest rates were zero we printed a [ __ ] ton of money and the dollar started rewards left less and less and so you're faced with two choices to get inflation back under control they have to raise interest rates and the second it becomes more expensive to borrow companies start collapsing companies that were like basically shoddily run zombie companies yeah our entire economy is basically running on credit and and debt and so uh every single administration knows that it that there's a problem that inflation is starting to get worse and worse and worse but they also know that if they are the ones to pull the plug on the party their whole party loses that it's basically hot potato and so they've been passing this back and forth and just every time they get in power they print a bunch of money to make everybody happy and do things so um the second someone stops printing money they turn off the spigot they stop buying the bad debt they stop printing money they start raising interest rates we're gonna have a recession there's like no way around it there's going to be a return if not a depression the unfortunate thing for biden specifically is that it looks like it's finally happening it looks like the chickens are coming to roost and so he's sort of getting hit with this no-lose situation which is where they're in this real catch-22 where the hot potatoes landed here and they can either raise interest rates collapse the economy destroy people's pensions make a real estate worth way less and so if you tank it you will lose the election guaranteed or you can print a bunch more money to band-aid it and keep inflation hot and kick it down the road but uh the problem is that won't work either because everyone's so mad about inflation that it looks like the democrats are about to get absolutely sweeped in the midterms and so what they're trying to do is talk a big game about how hard they're going to be on inflation while actually not doing very much about it at all because if they actually do anything it's a collapse and on the other side of it if you look at even more zoomed out crazy lens this is the us national debt it's 30 trillion dollars the payments on this debt are now one of the biggest parts of the yearly government budget and one of the best ways to make this debt not a problem is to inflate the currency so much that it's not worth as much so if you inflate the currency enough your debt is worthless the actual what it's actually amount is worthless and so we're running into a situation where um the only way the us can reasonably afford all of the debts that it owes not just on the national debt but on social security etc is to make the amount they owe worth less so there's it's kind of a no-win that's all starting to hit right now do you think this will increase the value of my shiba coin yes so that's the end that's the whole point everything i'm saying today is all to say that shebacoin is the greatest investment thank you for bringing that up yes this whole discussion all goes back to sheba coin which is what i was trying to say can we print more money so we already are and we already are printing an insane amount of money just to keep this [ __ ] ship going but we'd have to print some kind of absurd amount on top of this and that would only further cause the problem zoomers are the clutch or kick generation yeah bro it's all on you guys i love that i love that that's actually a good idea how about us millennials anyone in chat let's just do what the boomers did and kick the can the clock is running out we might barely make it and we can punt it to them and then they can clutch or kick this is actually sounding really good i think if we let jake paul president jake paul fix it [Music]
Boomer Benefits - Medicare Expert,1.0,ZrLBM7E7pc4,after over 12 months of debate and multiple changes the inflation reduction act has passed the Senate and House and was signed into law by the president although this act has several focuses regarding health care costs and Taxation the most impactful for Medicare beneficiaries is the prescription drug price reform the IRA legislation aims to make prescription drugs more affordable to the nearly 49 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the country the legislation includes Provisions that will cap costs on party plans allow negotiated prices for expensive meds provide 100 coverage on Part D vaccines and more hi I am Danielle Roberts co-founder of Boomer benefits and author of the best-selling book 10 costly Medicare mistakes you can't afford to make in this video I will dive into everything you need to know about the inflation reduction act and its impact on Medicare beneficiaries be sure to hit that subscribe button to stay up to date with all Medicare changes in the years to come [Music] next year beneficiaries will begin to feel the impact of the approved legislation first up is the cap on monthly insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in 2021 the senior Savings Program was rolled out and prohibited participating drug plans from charging more than a 35 copay for specific insulins listed on their formularies however not all plans were required to comply with this new inflation reduction act all Part D and Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage must cap covered insulin at 35 dollars per month starting in January this includes self-injected insulin and Insulin used with a pump our free Medicare q a group on Facebook gets hundreds of monthly questions about Medicare coverage for vaccines and some vaccines covered by Part D were still costly for many beneficiaries the IRA requires that part D plans must Now cover many of the vaccines that seniors need in full at 100 percent though Medicare Part B covers some vaccinations at 100 such as pneumonia flu covid-19 and hepatitis B some other necessary vaccines fall under Part D coverage One Part D vaccine in particular the shingles vaccine has been a costly and unwelcome surprise to beneficiaries who's sometimes paid for the vaccine in full due to their part D deductible under the new legislation the shingles vaccine must be covered in full bipart D plans without cost sharing of the application of their deductible it's great news that this vaccine will no longer have surprise out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries many people have expressed concern about the pharmaceutical companies raising the cost of certain drugs to make up for losses on other drugs however the legislation addressed this potential loophole as well beginning in 2023 if a drug manufacturer increases its drugs faster than the inflation rate it will have to pay rebates to avoid penalties [Music] in 2024 part D's catastrophic coverage stage is getting a makeover if you are familiar with the structure of Part D plans you know that there are four stages to all Part D plans the fourth and final stage is the catastrophic coverage stage which comes after the coverage Gap or donut hole in the catastrophic stage the beneficiary pays five percent of the cost of their drugs for the remainder of the calendar year after paying 25 cost sharing in the coverage Gap beneficiaries are often relieved to reach the catastrophic stage and pay only five percent however paying even five percent of the cost of medications with no cap can still result in high annual costs for Medicare beneficiaries especially those people on expensive brand name meds in 2024 that five percent cost sharing is gone for good the elimination of this cost sharing means that once you exit the donut hole you no longer have any out-of-pocket costs to worry about with your part D plan the initial coverage stage and the donut hole will remain the same nonetheless this will provide significant relief for Part D enrollees who find it challenging to pay for their necessary medications during the catastrophic coverage stage you are probably wondering if this will Skyrocket your Medicare Part D premiums fortunately in the same cost cutting vein medicare's Part D plans will have a cap on premium increases beginning in 2024. from 2024 to 2029 Medicare Part D premiums cannot increase more than six percent annually this change allows more control over premiums and protects the Medicare beneficiaries from over inflated premiums from the carriers the final change that you can expect in 2024 is an expansion of the low income subsidy program many people know this program as extra help today eligibility for this program starts when income is at 135 percent of the federal poverty level but will change to begin at 150 percent in 2024. I am particularly happy about this one because we've seen so many people over the years who are very close to qualifying for that extra help but missed it when their income was just slightly over the limit qualifying for the subsidy eliminates the deductible and provides lower co-pays making it more affordable for low-income beneficiaries for their necessary outpatient medications foreign developments in the ira is the two thousand dollar Part D cost cap capping out of pocket prescription costs has been a topic of conversation for years this change will essentially stop the money bleeding when you're out of pocket costs on cover prescription drugs at hit 2000 starting in 2025. the cap will spread throughout the year and essentially eliminate the donut hole stage once and for all the change also allows seniors to spread the burden of the cost throughout the calendar year however please note that there will be no change or impact on the initial coverage stage where you pay reasonable co-pays for your medications foreign beginning in 2026 the federal government will be able to negotiate the cost of certain high priced single-sourced and biological drugs under this new negotiation program the HHS will publish a list of drugs that are eligible for negotiation and the list will include 50 Part D and 50 Part B drugs with the highest total expenditures in the most recent 12-month period negotiated prices must take effect for 10 eligible drugs in 2026 and increased to 20 drugs in 2029 although beneficiaries won't see the negotiated prices until 2026 the government will be taking a significant step in creating more affordable drug prices for seniors which should ultimately benefit all Medicare beneficiaries in the long run though controversial in many ways there is no question that the inflation reduction act will provide much needed relief for many seniors regarding the high cost of prescription drugs Medicare is a behemoth of a program that offers incredible benefits for American seniors however it often comes with confusing intricacies that can be difficult to piece together the Boomer benefits team is committed to helping you better understand your Medicare benefits and be here for you when the inevitable issues arise on the back end we are proud to be one of the only companies of our size with unmatched Part D help for our clients this is just one reason why you will love working with our client service team so be sure to check out the video next to learn 12 other reasons foreign [Music]
Libertarian Europe,1.0,1O3fHAsdjNg,hi my name is ludwig von mises and today i will explain what inflation is in the 16th century when the gold and silver reserves of america were exploited by colonists huge amounts of these precious metals were carried to europe since currencies of the time were minted out of these precious metals there was a general tendency for prices to rise in the same way nowadays when a government increases the amount of money in the economy all money loses purchasing power and consequently prices tend to rise this phenomenon that i've just described is known as inflation unfortunately some people prefer to see inflation not as an increase in the quantity of money but as a rise in prices though that is only one of inflation's effects this semantic revolution is one of the main features of our day it tries to change the meaning of inflation making many people call inflation not the large increase in the money supply but one of its consequences the general trend of prices rising this semantic revolution is far from harmless it plays an important role in fostering popular trends favoring inflationism with this revolution there is no longer a term to designate what the word inflation means it is then difficult to fight a policy that has no name statesmen and writers are no longer able to use a term that the general public understands and relates to the problem of issuing large additional amounts of currency another drawback is that many inflationists say they fight inflation when in fact they promote it you see if inflation is the rise in prices a layman can be convinced that the fault is with greed and opportunism that of businessmen who want ever greater profits but if inflation is the massive expansion of the money supply then the blame lies with governments and their respective central banks for abusing their monopoly over currency it is not uncommon to see politicians and even economists arguing that there is no relationship between monetary expansion and the general increase in prices now under current technological conditions nothing would be easier than making scraps of paper and printing some monetary figures on them in the united states for example where all bills are of the same size printing a one thousand dollar bill would cost the government no more than printing a one dollar bill well let's travel back in time and go back to the 18th century when the first attempts were made to issue bank notes and assign them the status of currency many governments believe that bankers had some magic formula that allowed them to create wealth out of thin air a few years before the french revolution when france was in financial trouble the king sought out one of these ingenious bankers and appointed him to an important position and so monsieur necker famous madame de stahl's father became france's finance minister and everyone expected him to solve the country's financial problems at the time neca decided to send money to the colonists of america to help them in the war of independence against england but he did so without raising taxes seen from today that was certainly the wrong way to try to solve problems what i want to demonstrate is that there is no magic formula if the government needs money it has to obtain it by imposing taxes on its citizens or by borrowing money but most governments think that there is another magical method of obtaining the necessary money which is simply to print it if the government wants to do something beneficial build a hospital for example the government's means for raising the required money is to collect taxes from the citizens and build the hospital with the amount thus acquired in that case there will be no increase in prices because when the government raises money for the construction of the hospital the citizens burdened by this tax are forced to reduce their spending and in that case the amount of money in circulation is not increased of course the government won't buy exactly the same goods that the citizens would buy but the point is that on average there is no rise in prices as a result of the construction of the hospital by the government i chose the example of a hospital precisely because it is so common to hear that inflation is only bad when it is used for bad ends so let's assume that the government always uses the new money it is issued for the best possible purposes it turns out that the issue is not how the money is spent it is how it is obtained by the government for example the government could use the money raised through taxes to hire new employees or to raise the salaries of those already in its service these employees having had an increase in their salaries are then able to buy more when the government collects taxes from citizens and applies this sum to increase the salaries of its staff taxpayers will have less to spend but public servants will have more in this case the trend for prices to rise will not occur but if the government prefers to substantially expand the money supply that is printing a lot of new money or simply typing numbers in the bank accounts of people through easy and cheap credit as it happens nowadays with the advent of technology then some people will start to have more money while everyone else still has as much as before thus those who receive the newly printed money will compete with those who are previously buyers and since there are no more goods than before but there are more units of money in the market and since there are people who can buy more now than yesterday there will be an additional demand for an unchanged quantity of goods therefore prices will tend to rise but it is important to point out that the upward trend in prices will be established step by step since it is not the famous price level when we speak of price level the image that people form in their minds is that of a liquid that rises or falls according to the increase or decrease in its quantity but which like a liquid in a reservoir always rises evenly but with prices there is no such thing as evenly as an effect that became known as the cantion effect explains prices do not change to the same extent much less immediately after monetary expansion there are always prices that change faster fall or rise faster than others and there's a reason for that people do not all precisely buy the same goods in the same quantities on the same day the extra money that the government printed and spent is not used to purchase all goods and services evenly it is used in the purchase of certain commodities the prices of which will rise while others will still remain at the prices held before the new money was introduced into the market so when inflation starts different groups of the population get affected in different ways the groups who first receive the new money gain an advantage over those that receive the new money last when prices have gone higher let's illustrate this with an example suppose the government issues substantial amounts of money to pay for a war and with that new currency it buys ammunition the first to receive the additional money then are the ammunition industries and those who work for them they end up earning higher profits and earning higher wages because their businesses flourish why is that because they were the first to receive the additional money and now having more money in their hands they can buy more and they buy from other people who manufacture and sell the goods they demand these other people constitute a second group benefiting from the new money now received and this second group too considers inflation to be very beneficial for their business why not isn't it splendid to sell more and the owner of a restaurant located in the surroundings of a munitions factory for example says it's really wonderful ammunition workers have more money they are coming to my establishment like never before they're all supporting my restaurant this makes me very happy the situation is as follows those groups to whom money arrives first have their purchasing power increased and can continue to buy many goods and services at prices that match with the previous state of the market at the situation prevailing on the eve of inflation but there are other groups of the population for whom this money arrives much later these people find themselves in an unfavorable situation before they have access to the additional money prices have already risen and they are obliged to pay higher prices than previously for some commodities they wish to acquire or practically all of them while their earnings remain the same or do not increase proportionally to the prices at each moment therefore those groups directly affected by inflation are all different for some of them inflation is not that bad and they even defend its extension here comes the resulting issue governments tend to prefer inflation to increasing taxes increasing taxes is an extremely unpopular measure we have had revolutions that started due to an increase in taxes on the other hand inflation more hidden is not that unpopular yet of course most politicians are not going to say i will adopt inflation as a method the technical procedures used to produce inflation are very complex which makes the common citizen with too little time to delve into the topic not realize that inflation has started it is not easy to simplify such complex topics and i certainly wouldn't have written huge works on this topic if they're as simple as they seem to be but fundamentals are precisely these if the amount of money in circulation increases while other things remain the same the value of money falls well let's go back in time again and look at one of the biggest inflations of all history the one that took place in the german reich after the first world war and that reached its peak in the post-war period the government as expected did not announce anything it simply made the central bank print more money ultimately great inflation ends with the collapse of the currency giving rise to a catastrophe a situation like that which occurred in germany in 1923. on the 1st of august 1914 one dollar was at par with four marks and 20 fennigs nine years and three months later in november 1923 one dollar was quoted at a staggering 4.2 trillion marks in other words the mark was no longer worth anything some say at the end of the day we're all dead i'm sorry to confirm that they are correct but the question is how long will the present moment last in the 18th century there was a famous lady madame de pompadour to whom the following saying is assigned aprenu le deluge after us the flood madame de pompadour died shortly afterwards but her successor madame dubari survived a little longer only enough to be beheaded for many the long run soon becomes the present and the more inflation advances the more the long run is faced as unanticipated let us return to the case of germany which the whole world witnessed many books have described the events of that period and i have seen with my own eyes a similar situation in my country austria for many years the german people believed that their inflation was nothing more than a temporary situation which would soon end as the inflation continued however the population thought it wiser to buy everything that was for sale anything instead of keeping the money in their pockets furthermore people reasoned that it was not convenient to lend money to be a creditor on the other hand it was excellent business to borrow money to be in debt debt would buy you anything in those times thus inflation continued to feed on itself inflation continued in germany until the autumn of 1923 at that time the country's factories paid their workers every morning one day in advance and the worker who was accompanied by his wife to the factory immediately gave her his earnings of the day all the millions he had just received she would then promptly go to a store to buy anything she saw what most people knew at the time the mark lost overnight an incredible 50 percent of its purchasing power money melted in people's pockets like a chocolate bar over a hot oven this final phase of german inflation did not last long after a few days the whole nightmare was over the mark had lost all value and a new currency had to be established we must remember that in the end we may all be dead in fact there is no doubt that we will all be dead but we should take care of our earthly affairs during this brief interval in which we are allowed to live the best we can and one of the measures necessary for this purpose is to abandon inflationary policies you
Kano Akademy,1.0,jAvZSGUCWjg,welcome back to Kano Academy today we'll be covering the subject of Economics by discussing inflation in today's video we'll focus on what is inflation as well as the different types of inflation and the causes of inflation including some of the consequences of inflation as well as several measures to combat inflation please watch until the end of the video because we'll also provide you with some valuable tips to help you Ace your assignments tests and exams so let's get started as an introduction let us Define what we mean by the term inflation inflation refers to a sustained and significant increase in the general price level over a period of time and at the same time a decline in the buying power of money there are different types of inflation in this next section we will look at the following four type types which are consumer inflation producer inflation and all-inclusive inflation and hyperinflation let's briefly discuss each of these types starting with consumer inflation this is also known as CPI which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services that are typically purchased by consumers this includes things like food clothing transportation and housing producer inflation is another type of inflation this is also known as PPI this measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services that are typically purchased by businesses this includes things like raw materials intermediate goods and energy another type of inflation is known as an all-inclusive inflation all inclusive inflation measures the rate of change in prices of all goods and services for both consumer and produce sir this is a broader measure of inflation than CPI or PPI the last type of inflation we will look at is hyperinflation hyperinflation is a very high rate of inflation typically defined as an annual inflation rate of 50 or more hyperinflation can be very disruptive to an economy as it can lead to a loss of faith in the currency and a collapse of the economy inflation can be caused by various factors in this next section we will discuss these two factors starting with demand pull inflation this occurs when there is excessive demand for goods and services relative to the available Supply when demand outpaces Supply prices tend to rise another cause of inflation can be cost push inflation this happens when the cost of production increases leading to higher prices factors such as rising wages increased raw material costs or higher taxes can contribute to cost push inflation there are numerous consequences of inflation in this next section we will discuss how inflation affects the following starting with debtors and creditors debtors benefit because they receive money with a high purchasing power and repay their debt with money with low purchasing power creditors on the other hand may suffer due to inflation inflation also impacts on wage and salary earners people with a fixed income will be able to purchase less as prices are rising another consequence of inflation can be felt by investors and Savers assets with a fixed nominal value have a fixed return and lower purchasing power as prices increase furthermore real value of savings also decreases inflation also affects taxpayers in South Africa income is taxed on a progressive system therefore inflation causes what is termed as a bracket creep this is when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets or reduces the value of credits deductions and exemptions bracket creep essentially results in an increase in income taxes without an increase in real income lastly another consequence of inflation is the disruption of industrial peace which is often caused by wage bargaining and usually accompanied by strikes and mass action there are a number of measures that the government and policy makers can use to fight inflation when it gets too high in this next section we highlight three types of policy measures to be used to combat inflation let's start with fiscal measures these are specific measures taken by the government and particularly the Minister of Finance regarding Taxation and expenditure these measures can include the following an increase in direct taxation such as personal income tax which will help to decrease demand an increase in indirect taxation such as vat which will lead to a decrease in spending because Goods become more expensive a loan Levy which will ultimately reduce disposable income of consumers the state could consider cutting back on expenditure by canceling government projects like roads hospitals and schools the state could also impose surcharges on imported goods this will increase the price of these imported goods resulting in many people being unable to afford to buy these Goods the country's Reserve Bank and the government can also apply certain monetary measures to curb inflation including the following the Reserve Bank can adjust the quantity of money to meet the needs of the economy through EG open market policy thus maintaining a fine balance The Reserve Bank can also curb inflation caused by excess Demand by reducing the money supply The Reserve Bank can also apply moral pressure on financial institutions to be more careful when granting credit the repo rate is another tool used by central banks to manage monetary policy and influence economic conditions while the repo rate is primarily used to control borrowing costs and stimulate or restrict economic activity it can indirectly impact savings as well when the Central Bank increases the repo rate it often leads to higher interest rates offered by commercial banks on savings accounts and fixed deposits this can make saving more attractive as individuals can earn higher Returns on their savings the prospect of earning a better interest rate can therefore encourage people to save more additional measures that can be taken to combat inflation include the following increase productivity this is a long-term measure generated through improved Education and Training which allows more people to be employed and ensures they are more productive price control by fixing the price of certain essential Goods the government assures they remain affordable wage policy the government can also take a decision to break the inflationary spiral of increased wages and prices by keeping the increase in wages below or at the level of inflation stricter conditions for Consumer Credit the government can also make it harder for consumers to get credit in order to restrict their spending encourage personal savings as indicated previously The Government Can Implement measures to encourage savings for example by cutting taxes on savings the imbalance between demand and Supply is corrected by increased savings as people save more and spend less relaxed import controls the government and policy makers may also consider relaxing import control measures through tariff reductions removal of import quotas easing import restrictions and entering into free trade agreements another measure to combat inflation is by using floating exchange rate this is when prices are automatically adjusted to International conditions indexation this is a policy of linking prices of items such as wages pensions and mortgage bond interest rates to price indices in order to eliminate the effects of inflation before we continue as promised here are five quick study tips starting with number five start studying early don't wait until the night before the exam to start studying give yourself plenty of time to learn the material so that you can absorb it properly number four create data study schedule and stick to it break down the material into manageable chunks and schedule time to study each day this will help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed number three find a study method that works for you some people prefer to read their textbooks While others prefer to take notes or watch videos experiment with different methods until you find one that helps you learn the material effectively number two take breaks studying for long periods of time can be counterproductive get up and move around every 20 to 30 minutes to avoid getting burned out and very important number one get a good night's sleep before the exam this will help you be alert and focused on exam day now back to today's topic just to recap on what we covered in this video inflation refers to a sustained and significant increase in the general price level over a period of time this means that on average the prices of goods and services are rising while the purchasing power of a unit of currency is decreasing there are also different types of inflation in this video we looked at the following four types which are consumer inflation producer inflation all inclusive inflation as well as hyperinflation we also learned the various factors that cause inflation including demand pull inflation and cost push inflation we also covered a number of consequences as a result of inflation and also learned that there are a number of measures that can be taken to combat inflation including fiscal and monetary policy measures that the government and policy makers can use to fight inflation we also listed other measures to be considered to understand more on this topic please take time to re-watch this video we hope we were able to provide more clarity on the topic of inflation if we have please let us know by leaving us a comment below this video we would love to know what you have learned on this topic you can also leave us a thumbs up to show your appreciation also make sure you like this video and take time to share and subscribe for more until we meet again happy learning from all of us at Kano Academy stay creative stay curious stay connected with Kano Academy
Prager U,1.0,oNZ-YNHw87k,things I don't understand inflation or whatever it's called just print more money but you would lose its value okay then make it more valuable okay not that forget that a 12-year-old is somehow using $200 worth of products in one video I'm not looking to spar with a pre-teen but we can't just print money it's economics 101 you can't just magically create more money to curb inflation and history warns us from wheelbarrows of cash in post World War I Germany to the1 trillion bill in modern day Zimbabwe Reckless money printing devastates economies and decimates the middle class it's as simple as supply and demand printing more money means each dollar has less value and that is a problem for absolutely everybody
Money & Macro,1.0,WVAn0DW2asI,"Fed up with decades of sky high inflation, Argentineans have just elected a controversial new president who promised to Dollarize the economy, which means abolishing the central bank and ending the Argentinean peso. But is that a good idea? Well, actually, the plan is more thought out than you might think as it was drafted by a well-known Argentinean economics professor and backed by several prominent US based professors such as John Hopkin’s Steve Hanke, and Stanford's John Cochrane. At the same time, most economists have argued for decades that it is a really bad idea, and most Argentinian economists indeed appear to be against the plan. So who is right? What are the problems that dollarization is supposed to fix? How will it fix them? And why are so many economists against this plan? Well, to find out, I've immersed myself in the main arguments of both camps, as well as research about how dollarization has affected other countries that have given up their own currency in the past. And yeah, let's just say that dollarization in the past has almost always crushed inflation while at the same time creating a lot of different new problems. But before getting into the arguments in favor and against, we first need to get into the problem with Argentina's economy. First, let's start with an optimistic message. I know Argentina’s economy has a really, really bad reputation. But actually, if we compare it to other Latin American economies like Brazil, Chile and El Salvador, it's economic growth in dollar terms per person has not been so bad. On the other hand, if we compare it to European and Asian economies like Spain, Korea and China, we can see that economic growth has not been great either. What's worse is that economic growth has been very volatile, meaning that Argentina had to deal with two massive recessions just in the last couple of decades. That being said, I think that the real problem that has given Argentina's economy such a bad name has been inflation. After all, as you can see here, the country was hit by hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990 and then again by sky high inflation in 2002 and 2003. It has now just emerged from an entire decade of sky high inflation that has only gotten worse. And so against this backdrop, I think it makes total sense that Argentinean voters were just completely fed up with the economy and voted for a president with a radical proposal for “the elimination of the central bank, Dollarization”. And in practice, Mr. Miller and his advisers have said that this means that the peso will disappear and so the central bank will no longer manage its own currency. Instead, like El Salvador, Ecuador and Zimbabwe have done before it. Argentina will come to rely completely on the United States dollar as its national currency. But how will dollarization fix Argentina's economic problems of mediocre growth, excessive volatility, and sky high inflation? Well, according to its proponents, dollarization will likely solve all of these problems or once and for all, by taking away the ability of the central bank to bail out the government by printing a lot of money and thereby increasing inflation and making the country less attractive for investors. But are these claims realistic? To find out, let's have a look at what happened to other countries that dollarized their economies previously. First, let's have a look at the cases of Italy, Spain and Greece. And yeah, before you say anything, these countries did not adopt the US dollar, but they did dollarized their economy because in economics we tend to say that dollarization just means abandoning your old currency for a currency issued by someone else. So yeah, I understand that this is confusing. But by adopting the Euro, these countries have dollarized their economy. And as you can see here, much like Argentina, these South European countries famously had quite high inflation compared to, for example, Germany. But when they started the dollarization process in the 1990s, by preparing to adopt a euro, their inflation rate indeed rapidly converged to the low levels of Germany. Similarly, while Ecuador and El Salvador were initially known as high inflation countries, their inflation rates started closely following that of the United States after they dollarized in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Finally, if we have a look at the inflation rate of Argentina itself, we can see that after adopting a so-called currency board in 1991, Argentina's inflation rate quickly dropped to low levels, only to shoot up again after Argentina abandoned its currency board in 2002. Now, at this point, you might be wondering what the heck is a currency board? Well, in short, I think you can look at it as a scale. On the one hand, some countries have their own currency, of which value is freely determined by people trading currencies in the financial markets. On the other end of the scale, you have countries that have abandoned their currencies completely and in between. Though some countries manage their own currencies only to a certain extent because they have promised to keep them roughly in line with another currency such as the US dollar or euro. This type of arrangement is called a currency peg. However, currency pegs are difficult to maintain. For example, if you want to peg your currency to the US dollar, then and then you create a lot of currency to stimulate the economy. You could potentially get a scenario where people figure out that you have issued more currency than there are dollars in your economy, prompting them to call your bluff and forcing you to abandon the peg. But there is one other arrangement in which this is impossible, and that is the currency board in which you commit to holding exactly $1 for each dollar equivalent of your own currency that you issue. So in essence, it is almost the same as complete dollarization, with the only difference being that if you run out of dollars, you could still abandon the currency board. On the other hand, it is extreme difficult to dollarized an economy, so Dollarization is pretty much like a currency board, but without a way back. And this is exactly why these economists are now proposing that Argentina should dollarize. They say that while the currency board worked really well in the past, Argentina's bad, bad politicians just couldn't stick with the program. And by abandoning it, they cost inflation to come back again. So, in essence, they now propose dollarization rather than to have another currency board to prevent the next government or the government after that from allowing inflation to come back. And yeah, as the experience by Italy, Greece, El Salvador and Ecuador has shown us, it will probably work to eliminate inflation, but will also help Argentina to grow its economy and to avoid all of these painful crises? Well, according to these economists, Dollarization can drastically increase growth in two ways. First, it creates confidence that inflation is gone and that there will be no wild exchange rate swings anymore, meaning that both foreign and local investors will be much more eager to invest in Argentina again. Second, since the government now has a lot of policies in place to protect the value of the peso, such as capital and money restrictions, these can now be removed after the dollarization which will then lead to much more investment and trade. However, here, if we look at what happened to other countries that dollarized, the evidence is not so clear as it was with inflation. First of all, let's have a look at the European countries that abandoned their own currency for the euro in 2001. At first the impact was indeed that way more investment was unlocked for these countries, which is reflected by the fact that their average interest rates went down to roughly the level of German interest rates. Similarly, borrowing costs for El Salvador and Ecuador dropped massively after they dollarized their economies. So I think that this is some pretty compelling evidence that, as these economists have claimed, Dollarizing your economy makes it more attractive for investors. However, then the question becomes, will this increase investment lead to more economic growth and to less extreme boom and bust cycles? And there I think the evidence is really not so clear. For example, if we look at the economic growth of dollarized El Salvador and Ecuador and compare it to non dollarized peers in South America, we can see that world growth was just very meh, very average. And if we zoom in a bit more, they also don't appear to be very stable. Now, although Ecuador's economy has stagnated since 2014, which I guess you could call a form of stability. Similarly, if we look at the previously high inflation economies in southern Europe, did they grow much faster and avoid major crises thanks to the euro, thanks to dollarization? Well, for a while they did, but they certainly didn't avoid a major crisis, a crisis that hit them way harder than the low inflation economies of northern Europe. Now, of course, you could say Joeri, this is not very scientific. Perhaps you are just cherry picking examples, but actually I didn't when I had a look at a recent study that summarizes decades of economic studies on dollarization. Their conclusion was that dollarized countries on average display a slower and more volatile output growth and a lower inflation rate than non Dollarized countries, and fully dollarized countries on average exhibit slower growth than non dollarized and partially dollarized economies. Although they did note that estimates vary widely, both within and across studies. In other words, the evidence seems to suggest that dollarization indeed crushes inflation, but that it is bad for economic growth and tends to make economic crises worse. But why would that be the case? Well, that brings us to the case against dollarization, which we can talk about after discussing the case against letting your data fall into the hands of data brokers which can be prevented by enlisting the help of today's video sponsor Incogni. You see commercial data brokers make money selling your personal information, including employment history, residential address and SSN through a range of businesses. Some of them have even been discovered selling information to fraudsters who then used this data to scam people with deceptive offers such as bogus prices or car warranties. Now, similarly troubling, some data brokers have been hacked by criminals who then used stolen data to commit identity theft or to obtain loans under other people's names. And although you can request data brokers to remove your data, the process is so intricate that it could take years to do it manually. Thankfully, there is a solution. Incogni. Incogni will contact data brokers on your behalf, demand the removal of your personal data, and even handle any objections that they might have. All fully automated. If you're interested in trying it out, the first 100 people can use my personal discount code money macro for a 60% discount. Just visit in incogni.com/moneymacro and remove your private data from the market. And with that data hiding out of the way, let's dive into the case against dollarization. Because while we have seen that Milei’s plan to dollarize Argentina's economy is backed by some really serious economists. I think it is fair to say that on average, economists are against dollarization in general and also against dollarization in Argentina. And those against it have, in my opinion, made four main arguments. First, in general, economists these days tend to recommend that a country should have its own currency and that the value of that currency should be determined by the market, which is basically the opposite of dollarization. The main reason why they recommend this is that the exchange rate tends to act as a buffer against outside forces, giving a country more freedom to optimize its own economy rather than responding to outside events. Now, to see how that works, let's imagine that the United States raises interest rates to respond to high inflation at home. As a consequence, dollars will now naturally start flowing towards the United States, where they now can, of course, earn a higher interest rate. Currently, with a free floating currency, this would cause the pesos value to drop and potentially inflation to increase, but it won't hurt economic activity directly. As pesos keep circulating in Argentina. However, if Argentina were to completely dollarized its economy, then money would just flow straight out of Argentina, unless it increased its own interest rates as well, which can have a really bad side effects for Argentina's local economy. So in this situation, the exchange rate acts as a buffer against what is going on in the United States. Indeed, this effect could explain why, on average, the economies of dollarized countries are more volatile, since they can now no longer use the interest rate to stimulate or slow down their own economies appropriately. Instead, they just have to follow whatever the United States does. A second disadvantage that economists often mention is that by giving up your own currency, your central bank can no longer effectively bail out either the government or the banking system. This means that if there is a crisis, the government will have no choice but to implement harsh austerity measures at the worst possible time. Indeed, this is exactly what happened to countries like Greece, Spain and Italy at the height of the euro crisis in 2011. And while they eventually got bailed out, they still had to implement harsh austerity measures in the middle of a crisis. After which all of their economies stagnated. Thirdly. Thirdly, proponents of having your own currency have said that by issuing its own paper money, a government gets some money for free. Since they don't have to pay an interest rate on issuing paper money, whereas they do, if they borrow in the bond markets, this type of revenue is officially known as seigniorage. Finally, with regards to Argentina's current dollarization plan, many economists have made the case that to dollarize, well, you need dollars. And while lots of dollars already circulate in Argentina, the central bank simply does not have enough dollars to replace the current pesos in circulation with dollars. So is dollarization just a pipe dream? Well, not so fast. Of course. The proponents of dollarization have countered each of these arguments. Firstly, in general, economists have increasingly recognized that the buffer effect that exchange rates provide is far from perfect. Second, proponents like Professor Cochrane have argued that eliminating bailouts is exactly the point of dollarization and that this can be a good thing. Because politicians will realize that precisely because they cannot be bailed out by the central bank anymore, they will no longer borrow irresponsibly. Thirdly, in response to no longer having the seigniorage, Professor Cochrane said that indeed handing over in your eyes revenue is, in effect, a nice little present from Argentina to the United States government. But he also suggested that the country could likely strike a deal with the US later to see some of that money returned. Even better. Professor Emilio Ocampo has said that because Argentina's economy is already dollarized to a large extent, seigniorage revenue isn't that big anyway for Argentina. Finally, economist Steve Hanke has made the case that while the Argentinean central bank might not have enough dollars today, knowing that inflation is over and capital restrictions lifted, lots of dollars that are currently hidden under mattresses everywhere in Argentina would likely soon appear. Which is exactly what happened with Ecuador and other countries that Mr. Hanke advised Dollarized their economies. So who is right? Will dollarization work for Argentina? Well, after making the obligatory disclaimer that nothing in macroeconomics is certain and that the proponents of dollarization have all admitted that the policy is not a panacea and that it will have to be combined with many other good policies. I think that dollarization will work in solving Argentina's inflation problem simply because almost every country that tried it got rid of sky high inflation. However, I think that the evidence is pretty clear that Dollarizing your economy comes at the cost of lower economic growth and more extreme economic crises. And while I was convinced by the arguments of the proponents that dollarization can be done, even if it might take few years to fully implement, I simply was not convinced that full scale dollarization is a good idea and would argue instead that adopting a currency peg or a currency board is simply much smarter. After all, as the Greek and Italian experiences have shown, removing the central bank does not mean politicians will spend wisely from here on out. And abandoning your currency could mean that you would end up in a massive crisis and then cannot easily go back to having your own currency. In a more optimistic scenario. Adopting a currency board or peg will still a massively reduce inflation and attract investments that can be used to finally build Argentina into a modern, stable and prosperous economy, which can then, once again have a stable, free floating peso. I mean, as people like Peter Zeihan have noted, if we look at Argentina's geography, there is just so much potential there. And so to me, Dollarizing the economy feels a little bit like just giving up. That being said, given Argentina's history, it makes total sense to me that people are getting really desperate and want to try something completely different. So in the end, I think being in favor or against dollarization is really a matter of how much hope that you think that there still is for Argentina's economy. If you think that there is just no hope. Dollarization can make sense. But if, like me, you try to remain at least somewhat optimistic. Dollarization is the wrong move. And actually, given that Professor Emilio Ocampo recently stopped working with me, there are now some signs that Milei might start agreeing with me and will try a softer approach. But that is my take. What do you think? Should Argentina Dollarize? Or commit to a currency board or do something else? Let me know in the comments below.

Markets Mapped,1.0,OwH9dTJTkZk,welcome back to our series where we're explaining all the economic data releases that you see in the monthly cycle and how they relate to each other in order to better help you deal with them in the markets this week we're going to be taking a look at another inflation measure but this time it's the producer price index also known as ppi whereas last week we were talking about the consumer price index cpi and if you're not sure what cpi is or inflation in general then click up here and watch that one first and then come back to this one but if you are sticking around then let's get started ppi is the producer price index and it's an alternative measure of inflation it doesn't really catch the mainstream headlines in the same way that cpi and pce do but it's still an important release in its own right so ppi measures inflation by comparing the average selling prices received by domestic producers for their output this is one of the reasons it doesn't really carry the same weight as the cpi release because cpi measures what consumers are actually paying and therefore includes things like sales tax and markups that won't show in ppi so as an overall gauge of inflation in an economy those other releases are probably going to give a better picture instead ppi is measuring the changes in production costs and it covers a number of industries from agriculture to manufacturing but what does all of this actually mean well since it's measuring price changes earlier in the production stage it's often used as a gauge for what we may see in the bigger inflation data releases down the line because if producers face higher costs eventually these are likely to be passed on to retailers and then to consumers which would obviously show as increases in the cpi and pce releases ppi release is split into three categories we have the commodity index the stage of processing index and then the core reading and each of these represents different parts of the production chain so let's say for example the cost of raw materials are increasing then this would first show up in the commodity index this is showing the price that producers are paying for goods and if the cost of raw materials is on the rise then the stage of processing index which measures costs in the middle stages of production is also likely to increase and then at the end we have the core headline figure which measures price changes of finished goods at the end of the production chain so these finished goods then head off to retailers and ultimately consumers where the higher prices earlier in a production chain could eventually lead to higher costs of goods so let's go on to see how cpi relates to other data releases but first if you're finding this helpful i would love it if you would just tap that like button and help us keep doing what we're doing on this channel i'd really appreciate it let's move on so we've already seen how price changes in ppi can lead to changes in cpi and pce however it can also be used to filter out the causes of inflation in those releases for example if cpi and pce are on the rise but ppi is relatively stable then inflation is probably being caused by something other than input costs for retailers if they both increase at a similar rate then retailers are likely just maintaining their margins as input costs rise but if ppi is increasing and cpi and pce aren't then someone somewhere is soaking up the cost in the chain it could be producers or retailers and this may be a sign that prices are already high and they're expecting that consumers won't pay any further price increases so this would likely impact on margins which could result in lower earnings and lower profits for producers and retailers in this case they may try to find buyers in export markets but they're likely going to see slower growth in earnings until consumer purchasing power recovers now if you want to know about the rest of the economic data releases then check out this playlist here to go through the series so far and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss when the next ones come out we're going to be covering all of them and linking them all together for you my name is nicholas this is market movers thank you so much for watching take care
Prepp - IAS,1.0,L92eadRu6zE,hi guys just a quick little announcement before today's video I know that a lot of you prefer to listen to these videos so I want to let you know that the entire AE library is up on Spotify so you can listen to it on the go without ads either way I hope you enjoy the video if 2022 was defined by one economic problem it would be inflation inflation in most advanced economies around the world right now is running very high with some countries once famed for their monetary stability seeing double-digit annual price increases these are also just the headline figures which don't account for a lot of the expenses endured by real households even though that's technically what they're supposed to do interest rates are perhaps the obvious example of this because they are somewhat of a double-edged sword they are the primary tool that central banks can use to rein in inflation but they also cause interest payments for regular households to increase at the same time that they are struggling to pay for everything else in the world that's suddenly 50 more expensive than it was two years ago these are just advanced economies as well select developing economies are running double-digit monthly inflation but for the most part these isolated examples are having these problems because of things like bad governance and a refusal to raise interest rates like everybody else is trying to do right now I'm not going to name names but I will will say that it's ironic that Thanksgiving is coming up soon raising interest rates in countries that still have consistently High inflation is the right move even if it is bitter medicine but as with most things a prevention is better than a cure so perhaps the most productive way to understand what is truly causing persistent inflation in our own economies is to look at other economies that aren't having that problem at all even if the lessons of places like Switzerland select European countries and yes even China are too late to implement in our own economies now they can potentially teach us a lot about why inflation actually happens and how to avoid it in the future so why are select countries from around the world not having the same problems with inflation that every other country is could we just do what they are doing to fix this inflation issue ourselves and at what cost did these economies gain their immunity from inflation once we have done all of that we can put the economy of Switzerland on the economics explained National leaderboard one of the most important things to understand about inflation is that inflation is goods and services becoming more expensive not money becoming less valuable that might just sound like a different side of the same coin but it's really important the reason this is important to understand is because different areas can have different rates of inflation at different times even if they are all using exactly the same currency this is normally not recognized because inflation is measured on a national level and Nations almost always use a single currency but inflation in California for example can be significantly higher or lower than inflation in Michigan at any given time when you think of inflation as the rising costs of goods and services this makes much more sense because different issues impacting market prices can impact different regions yes one way inflation can be increased is by governments and central banks injecting lots of cash into the economy to increase total demand more demand naturally leads to higher prices but there are other ways than inflation can come about that are more specific to individual regions Michigan for example might have a particularly cold winter which increases demand and therefore the price of energy to keep homes warm while California with its more temperate climate won't have the same problems and therefore won't experience that Rising price level another real example might be the tech boom that took place in California during the 2000s and 2010s lots of high-paying local jobs created a region of household demand much higher than the national average which is why most things in Californian cities cost more than the same things in our regional town if you have been looking at reported inflation figures in your own country you would have seen figures of around six to ten percent and I'm sure a lot of you would have thought that that couldn't possibly be true because your own cost of living had increased so much faster than that well there's a good chance you are probably right because inflation is measured using the increasing price of the Consumer Price Index which is a diverse selection of goods and services indicative of the spending of a regular Urban household so in a Twisted way inflation has been even worse than the news has been reporting not only due to inconsistent indexes but because inflation is a black hole decimating everything in its surroundings like stocks and bonds long touted as the perfect complementary Investments they've lost 36 trillion dollars this year that's more than the GDP of the entire United States and that's why this video was sponsored by Masterworks now the average 60 40 portfolio of these stocks and bonds that Millions rely on is having the worst year in a hundred years down 34 percent but Morgan Stanley one of the biggest banks in the world may have a way to rescue your sinking portfolio they say including alternative assets would potentially lower volatility and increase returns but which Alternatives not just gold or real estate but fine art CNBC says the global Rich see fine art as a hedge against inflation and perhaps a safer store of value than increasingly volatile stocks and crypto no wonder City reports the total median expenditure on Art could hit double its level last year that's in 2022 where we saw the worst start to the stock market in 50 years the difference is astounding and really exciting for investors looking to recoup some historic losses so how do you invest in art yourself without spending Millions with Masterworks Masterworks lets you invest in multi-million dollar works of art from legendary artists like also Basquiat and Banksy these are not nfts this contemporary art has outpaced the S P 500 by 131 for the past 26 years even during the Roaring bull market of the last decade that's how Masterworks has managed to deliver returns even in a year fraught with disaster in fact they saw the painting just over a week ago for a 17.5 percent net return that brings their three most recent sales to over 17 21 and 33 net returns as a result of this standout performance Masterworks has had to acquire and release more art onto their platform to meet demand and there is a waitlist to join their 550 000 plus other members but you can skip it just by clicking the link in the description if you live away from a big city or have abnormal spinning habits then chances are your cost of living would have increased faster than the headline figures because Niche products and services and markets in smaller economic centers normally suffer more during periods of high inflation now somewhere where we can see this actually represented in the figures is Europe because Europe is home to a lot of countries with the majority of them using the same currency the Euro France has had a reported year on year inflation rate of 6.2 percent which is still much higher than the European Central bank's Target inflation rate of 2 percent but it's much lower than a country like Latvia with an inflation rate of 22 percent despite using the same currency so how is one country using the same currency experiencing inflation almost four times higher than another country well there are the obvious issues Latvia is much closer geographically to Russia and Ukraine and is therefore more heavily impacted by disruptions in the region Latvia is closer to the now shut off industrial centers of Russia than is to most of the European Union so it naturally did more business with Russia and also lost a lot more due to trade sanctions but there is more to it inflation in France is measured differently to inflation in Latvia Latvia is a much poorer country than France and poorer country households naturally spend a larger portion of their income on the Bare Essentials like food and energy whereas in rich countries these items normally only take up a small share of household income this means the Consumer Price Index in Latvia will be more heavily weighted with things like food and energy at the moment food and energy are the markets most impacted by global events and because these markets are so heavily represented in Latvia's CPI its inflation rate is higher if France's inflation was measured using Latvia's Consumer Price Index its inflation rate would be a fair bit higher and if Latvia's inflation rate was measured using France's Consumer Price Index it would be a fair bit lower that doesn't mean that these calculations are flawed quite the opposite actually we measure inflation to get an idea of what is going on in the economy and the people within a nation are what drives that economy so it's important that the Consumer Price Index is indicative of the spending habits of people within that economy if White flags and poodle haircuts are not what most households in Latvia are spending their money on their economy shouldn't be measured on those goods and services it is still important to remember this detail though because it means that direct comparisons of inflation rates can often be misleading especially between countries with very different socioeconomic conditions but beyond that disclaimer no matter what metrics you use France is still running a lower rate of inflation than other EU countries and you might have noticed on this list a European country that is running an inflation rate half that of even France so what is Switzerland doing right Switzerland is a very wealthy country its citizens are amongst the wealthiest in the world with only Australia and a select group of micro Nations giving it any real competition wealthier citizens are going to make for an economy that is less susceptible to inflation because richer people are going to spend a lower portion of their income on Essentials and a higher portion on luxuries that they can choose to go without if they become too expensive restaurant meals are a great example of this wealthier households are going to spend more on restaurant meals than households that are struggling to make ends meet if inflation is very high those wealthy households might just choose to eat at home which will reduce demand for restaurant meals and force restaurants to reduce their prices by running sales to attract fickle customers back to their tables poorer households can't choose to stop spending money at restaurants because they likely weren't doing it to begin with and they also can't stop consuming Bare Essentials like food because well they're Bare Essentials without food you starve so people are willing to spend whatever they must to feed their families but there is still more to this Swiss Story one thing that a lot of other outlets have been focusing on is the relative stability of the Swiss franc when compared to the US dollar it is one of the few countries in the world that has not lost significant value this year the main reason for this relative strength is that the Swiss franc is heavily backed by large reserves of gold Financial assets real estate and bonds from other governments this means that the Swiss Central Bank can ensure the currency stability in the Foreign Exchange Market because if the price of the currency gets too low they can sell their assets in exchange for Swiss Francs and if the value of the currency gets too high they can trade their Franks for more assets people who have watched my videos on countries like China might remember that this sounds like a currency Peg but it is a little bit different in Switzerland's case because they do not Target a specific price they let the marketer determine the price for the most part but they will intervene if they feel it is necessary now this explanation is not wrong it just omits some very important details because remember inflation is not the same same thing as money becoming less valuable the real reason that Switzerland is writing out the global inflation storm so well is ironically because it does a lot of trade Switzerland is a country heavily dependent on trade both imports and exports the total value of all trade relative to the size of an economy is something that economists call Trade intensity Switzerland Imports about 300 billion US dollars worth of goods and services every year and exports about the same amount that works out to a per capita Import and Export value of around 35 000 per citizen for reference the USA exports around four thousand dollars per capita and imports just under seven thousand dollars per capita this does get a bit confusing because International Trade has normally been seen as one of the big contributing factors causing inflation with Global Supply chains and trade tensions having all manner of problems around the world but as with most things in economics it's important not to over generalize most of Switzerland's Imports come from its neighboring countries in the EU and the UK these trade routes are extremely direct with trains and trucks that won't suffer from closed ports or delays at distribution centers Switzerland is also able to leverage their strong currency to buy these Imports at a 10 discount from what they were 12 months ago in a country like the USA where total Imports account for a relatively low share of total output this wouldn't make a huge difference but remember the average Swiss citizen is importing 35 000 worth of stuff every year and if they were getting that stuff from Euro countries using their francs they would be three thousand five hundred dollars better off for no other reason than their strong currency which offsets a large part of any inflation they were subject to on the flip side most of Switzerland's exports are very high-end goods and services with significant value add that aren't going to be as heavily impacted by global unrestors large-scale low margin Commodities there are also smaller factors like the country's use of hydroelectric power for for a majority of its energy making it less susceptible to the oil and gas price volatilities a lot of other countries in Europe are suffering from so is there anything to learn from Switzerland unfortunately not really no apart from maybe seeing the benefits of investing in highly evaluating Industries and renewable resources Switzerland has actually historically been struggling with deflation which is slowing growth in an otherwise very prosperous country it's important to remember that economic slowdowns normally bring with them low inflation and a lot of economies that aren't having inflation problems right now are only in that position because they have larger economic issues that are crippling consumer demand you can go and watch our video on Japan or why China is not going to collapse to find out why deflation can be just as bad if not worse than inflation these problems aren't as present in Switzerland but most economies will still have to forego significant growth to get themselves into a position as stable as Switzerland's which is a fine trade to make when all of their citizens have a high standard of living but a high had a trade-off to make when sustained growth could be the key to lifting millions of people out of poverty beyond that I'm sure most economies would love to be Switzerland in the same way that I would love to be a multi-millionaire it's not feasible to point to one of the wealthiest countries in the world and ask other economies why they can't just do what Switzerland is doing but what we can learn from Switzerland is where it sits on the economics explained National leaderboard starting as always with size Switzerland has a GDP of 813 billion US Dollars which makes it the 20th largest economy in the world and it gets a 7 out of 10. that might not sound that impressive but GDP per capita is amongst the highest in the world at 93 457 dollars per citizen for reference the USA which is itself a remarkably productive country has a GDP per capita of just 69 288 this impressive figure is due to the highly technical industries that Swiss residents work in I have used the process of turning raw steel into wristwatches countless times on this channel as the perfect example of adding value in an economy and nobody does this better than the Swiss he gets a 10 out of 10. stability and confidence is also very high though it's days of banking for the world's secretive Elite are behind it it is still the go-to destination for more above-board financial operations because of its world-renowned neutrality and stability it gets a 10 out of 10. growth has been strong relative to its European neighbors but they haven't exactly been sitting the bar extremely high the perhaps overly careful governing system of the country favors slow stable growth and that's what they've been having it gets a 7 out of 10. finally industry while it's not massive the industries that they do have are World leading if you want the best Bankers you get a Swiss Banker if you want the best chocolate you get Swiss chocolate and if you want the best watches you get Swiss watches Swiss industry gets an 8 out of 10. altogether that gives the economy of Switzerland an average score of 8.4 out of 10 putting it into third place on the leaderboard thanks for watching mate bye
Arvin Ash,1.0,nziePav5OMg,"The description of how our universe has evolved from the moment of the big bang until today is known as the big bang model. But this model has some problems. For example, it doesn’t quite tell us why the universe is so homogenous, that is, looks pretty much the same everywhere, why it appears geometrically flat, and why there are no magnetic monopoles. As I discussed in the last video, cosmic inflation solves these problems, and accounts for much of the structure of the universe we observe today. Inflation occurred when the entire universe shortly after its beginning expanded exponentially fast, faster than the speed of light, for a very short period of time, perhaps only a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, such that the volume increased by a factor of something like 10^78. One implication of this cosmic inflation is that the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe may not be so homogenous. In the 1990s, scientists realized that this inhomogeneity on large scales could mean that inflation ended at different times in different places. And if that were true, then it would mean that the universe is likely far bigger and far more complex than we realize. In fact, the universe we are familiar with may be only a tiny fraction of all that exists. This concept is called ETERNAL inflation, and its implications are profound. What is this eternal inflation? And what would it imply for the true nature of reality? That’s coming up right now… If you’ve watched my videos before, then you know that I like to ask big questions, that sometimes don’t have clear answers. When this happens, some viewers invoke the hand of a creator. Most scientists try to stay away from this idea. But I recently found an inspirational science video on MagellanTV, today’s sponsor, that took on the question of a creator head-on in a rational way. And I think you would enjoy seeing it. It’s called simply, “The Cosmos.” And it asks the question, given how much knowledge we’ve gained, and how much we have yet to learn, is there is any evidence of a creator beyond the cosmos? Magellan offers thousands of fascinating documentaries like this. It’s a new kind of documentary service created by the film makers themselves. Featured topics include science, history, travel and technology. Magellan has a special offer right now for Arvin Ash viewers. If you click the link in the description, you can get free one month trial. You have got nothing to lose, and a world of knowledge to gain at your fingertips, just by clicking the link in the description. So be sure to take advantage of that. We stated in the previous video that Inflation occurred due to our universe having a lot of energy in the form of a scalar field – the inflation field. This field caused an enormous expansion of the universe but only for a split second. As the universe quickly cooled, it decayed into other fields and particles. After this expansion, the universe kept expanding but at a much slower rate. Using the equations of physics, and knowing approximately the total energy that this field would need to have, which can be calculated based on the total current energy of our universe, we can approximate how long inflation should last. And most models show that it would last for a miniscule amount of time, something like 10^-32 to 10^-36 seconds. But here’s the key point about these calculations. This prediction of how long inflation lasts, tells us only how long it should last ON AVERAGE. But quantum mechanics ensures that there will always be some randomness. Inflation could last a bit longer or shorter than expected in different parts of the universe. This is analogous to radioactive decay. Let’s take an isotope of Thorium for instance, Thorium 231. Its half-life is about 1 day. This means that if we have a kilogram of Thorium. After one day, about ½ kg will decay, to something like Protactinium 231. The following day, half the remaining 0.5 kg of Thorium will decay. So we will be left with a 0.25 kg of Thorium after two days. Similarly, the third day, half of the 0.25 kg will decay, and so on. What this means is that if you start out with 100 atoms of Thorium-231, then after 1 day, 50 of them will have decayed to Protactinium-231, and 50 will remain as Thorium. But the nature of quantum mechanics is such we can’t predict in advance, which of the 100 atoms will decay and which will not. So if we pick one atom at random and wait for it to decay, we could wait for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days or more. There is no telling. All we know is that if we have a large number of atoms, about half will decay every 24 hours or so. But we don’t know which ones. Inflation may work similarly. In the 1980s, Paul Steinhardt, Andrei Linde and Alexander Vilenkin realized that the exponential expansion of cosmic inflation, although it stopped in our part of the universe, could continue without end in other unobservable parts of the universe. Like the concept of half-life, quantum uncertainty may cause on average, half the volume of the expanded universe to stop inflating after about 10^-32 seconds, but it could continue in the other half of the universe. So here is the astonishing part. Let’s say, space expanded exponentially, by at least 10^78x or more, and stopped in one part of the universe. This becomes like a bubble - a bubble universe. This could be our universe, or any arbitrary universe. But space could continue to keep expanding exponentially in another part of the universe, and after another 10^-32 seconds, it stops in another half of the just expanded universe, forming another bubble universe. So now we have two universes, but the space between these two universes keeps expanding exponentially. And as parts of this newly created space stop inflating, more bubbles form. But again the space between these bubbles keeps expanding exponentially. Steinhardt and others realized that if the if the decay of the inflation field happens slower than the rate of expansion of the universe, then inflation could go on, in principle forever, creating more and more bubble universes. Now there is a big difference between the analogy of radioactive decay and inflation. In radioactive decay, since we have a limited amount of material, and no new material is created with the passing of every half-life, eventually all of the material decays over time. But in eternal inflation, since new space is being created all the time, inflation never stops. This is why it’s called ETERNAL inflation. For all practical purposes each of these parts where inflation stopped looks like a separate universe, or bubble, and is independent of what happens in other parts of the universe. In fact, space expands so much between them, expanding faster than the speed of light, no information can ever travel between the bubbles, no matter how long you wait. And they will never collide. So they are informationally isolated from each other. If the theory of eternal inflation is correct, we are inside one of these bubbles. And it is highly unlikely that we are in the first bubble, or even in the first few bubbles. Given the vast number of bubbles being created at every instant, we could be in any one of them. So our most accepted current STANDARD theory of the big bang goes something like this: About 13.8 billion years ago, the big bang happened. We don’t know what caused it or what happened before this event. But about 10^-32 seconds later, cosmic inflation happened, causing the universe to expand exponentially. Then it ended. And then the universe continued to expand but at a much slower pace. And these events largely explain what we observe in the universe today, 13.8 billion years later. With ETERNAL inflation, the story changes to something like this. We don’t know what happened at the beginning. But a fraction of a second later, inflation happened. This could have happened arbitrarily far in the past. It is also possible that there may not have been a beginning at all. Many bubble universes formed and are continuing to form. At some point within this space, our bubble formed. It was probably not the first, and is certainly not the last. Inflation will continue forever continually sprouting new bubbles of universes in the space that is created within it. But what we observe in our bubble 13.8 billion years after its formation, can be explained by the big bang model. So, what we think of as the start of the universe may be just the point at which inflation simply ended in our part of the universe. But what the universe is on much larger scales is an unimaginably vast multiverse of universes. You might be wondering, what is the nature of these other universes? Are they like ours or are they different? Well, no one knows for sure, but it’s probably a good bet that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics would still apply, since inflation is derived from quantum mechanics. Most physicists also think there is probably some overarching, overall laws of nature that describe the entirety of the multiverse, and these laws describe how the inflation field expands, and how bubbles form. Are these universes the same as ours? There is nothing in the laws of physics that requires a universe to have the same laws as ours or the same fundamental constants as ours. For example the masses of fundamental particles like electrons could be different, or the fine structure constant, which determines the strength of the electromagnetic force could be different. Depending on the various combinations of fundamental constants, you could have universes where no stars formed, or universes where only neutrons exist, or various other universes. You might be thinking this sounds outlandish, perhaps even preposterous. Prove to me that this is true. Well, the unfortunate fact is that we will never be able to directly detect these other universes because the space between them is expanding so fast that no communication at the speed of light could occur. Short of creating a wormhole between one universe to another, which is probably not possible, we can’t know whether they actually exist. However, the key to understanding the early universe lies in the study of high energy physics. If we can replicate the energies and temperatures close to the big bang, it might give us a clue as to whether eternal inflation could be correct. Currently, the state of the art facility, and one of man’s greatest technological achievements, the Large Hadron Collider, in Switzerland can come nowhere close to the energies near the Big Bang. For example the highest energies created in the LHC are about 10^13ev (electron volts) but the energies near the big bang were many magnitudes higher, closer to 10^24 eV. So we can’t simulate those conditions, but perhaps a new generation of colliders will get us closer. There may also be some clues about the early universe in gravitational waves. Our instruments are not yet sensitive enough, however to detect these very weak background gravitational waves which probably fill the sky like the cosmic microwave background does. These gravitational waves would have been remnants of the big bang. A 2018 paper published posthumously by Steven Hawking and coauthor Thomas Hertog alludes to the idea that the background gravitational waves may hold the clues that tell us about whether potential multiverses exist. The planned European Space Agency gravitational wave observatory, LISA, may be able to detect these. Just like in the past, in 1543, when Copernicus showed that the earth was not the center of the universe, but that it revolved around the sun. That made the sun the new center. Then in 1911, American astronomer Harlow Shapley showed that the sun was not the center of the universe. And you have to remember, that what we called the universe up to this point was just the Milky Way galaxy. Then in 1924, American astronomer Edwin Hubble showed us that our galaxy was just one of many in an ever expanding universe. Likewise, we may someday find out that the Big bang was not the beginning of everything. 13.8 billion years ago was simply OUR big bang, not THE big bang. And that it’s only a tiny blip of a bubble in a vast ocean of bubbles that is getting exponentially larger with every passing fraction of a second. So it appears that in our historical search for cosmic significance, the more we look, the more technologically sophisticated instruments we employ, the more we discover that we are perhaps even more insignificant than we ever imagined.

Universe Lair,1.0,7xPEuoNdFNY,if there was an eternal Universe does that negate the theory of the Big Bang or does it mean that there's a constant cycle of big bangs and then expansion and then recompression or yeah it could do so there's a theory called Eternal inflation the idea that SpaceTime was around before the Big Bang there was doubling in size every 10 to Theus 37 seconds which is point 37 kns and then the idea is that draws to a close so it quite naturally sort of dies away and the expansion slows down and all the energy that was causing that expansion sort of gets dumped into space and heats it up and makes particles and that's what we call the big bank and those theories say that that slowing down just happens in little patches so most of the universe is still inflating at that insane speed and just little patches stop and they're big bangs so you get multiple universes a Multiverse it's called the inflationary Multiverse and we are in one of those bubbles

Robert Reich,1.0,Zi4KMCQuQYE,inflation inflation everybody's talking about it but ignoring one of its biggest causes corporate concentration now prices are undeniably rising in response the fed is about to slow the economy even though we're still at least four million jobs short of where we were before the pandemic and millions of american workers won't get the raises they deserve republicans haven't wasted any time hammering biden and democratic lawmakers about inflation skyrocketing inflation inflation inflation but don't fall for their fear-mongering everybody's ignoring the deeper structural reason for price increases the concentration of the american economy into the hands of a very few corporate giants with the power to raise prices if the market were actually competitive corporations would keep their prices as low as possible as they competed for customers even if some of their costs increased they would do everything they could to avoid passing those costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices for fear of losing business to competitors but that's the opposite of what we're seeing corporations are raising prices even as they rake in record profits corporate profit margins hit record highs last year you see these corporations have so much market power they can raise prices with impunity so the underlying problem isn't inflation per se it's lack of competition corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits take the energy sector only a few entities have access to the land and pipelines that control the oil and gas powering most of the world they took a hit during the pandemic as most people stayed home but they are more than making up for it now limiting supply and ratcheting up prices chevron exxon have doubled their profits this isn't about inflation this is about price gouging or look at consumer goods in april 2021 procter gamble raised prices on staples like diapers and toilet paper citing increased costs in raw materials and transportation but png has been making huge profits after some of its price increases went into effect it reported an almost 25 profit margin looking to buy your diapers elsewhere well good luck the market is dominated by p g and kimberly clark which not entirely coincidentally raised its prices at the same time another example in april 2021 pepsico raised prices blaming higher costs for ingredients freight and labor it then recorded 3 billion in operating profits through september how did it get away with this without losing customers pepsi has only one major competitor coca-cola which promptly raised its own prices coca-cola recorded 10 billion in revenues in the third quarter of 2021 up 16 from the previous year food prices are soaring but half of that is from meat which costs 15 more than last year there are only four major meat processing companies in america which are all raising their prices and enjoying record profits get the picture the underlying problem is not inflation it's corporate power since the 1980s when the u.s government all but abandoned anti-trust enforcement all american industries have become more concentrated most are now dominated by a handful of corporations that coordinate prices and production this is true banks broadband pharmaceutical companies airlines meatpackers and yes soda corporations in all these industries and more could easily absorb higher costs including long overdue wage increases without passing them onto consumers in the form of higher prices but they aren't instead they're using their massive profits to line the pockets of major investors and executives while both consumers and workers get shafted how can this structural problem be fixed fighting corporate concentration with more aggressive anti-trust enforcement biden has asked the federal trade commission to investigate oil companies and he's appointed experienced antitrust lawyers to both the federal trade commission and the justice department so don't fall for republicans fear-mongering about inflation the real culprit here is corporate power [Music] you

Markets Mapped,1.0,MpsTYYgMmKY,you've probably noticed that when you see inflation data in the economic calendar or when you read the financial news they'll often refer to headline inflation and core inflation so what's the difference well as you know the way that inflation measures are usually explained is by referring to a basket of goods and services essentially you're measuring the price change over time of that basket of items and if the price of that basket of goods and services goes up that's inflation so headline inflation looks at a price of everything in that basket so it's the whole basket of goods and services whereas core inflation looks at the price of the basket after removing items that have more volatile prices like energy and food so it's the whole basket excluding certain items now policy makers like those guys at the central bank will usually focus more on Headline inflation James Butler's a policy maker at the Federal Reserve has previously mentioned that they prefer headline inflation because it includes everything a household is purchasing people don't generally have the options to just exclude food or fuel from their expenses although it would be pretty good if you could but that doesn't mean that core inflation is useless in fact it can give us a much better picture of what's going on overall in the economy so let's look at two broad scenarios so I can help you to understand this in scenario one headline inflation is significantly higher than core inflation if this is the case it could signal that prices are being driven by the volatile items like energy and food now since their prices can fluctuate up and down a lot more often inflation in those areas tends to fall more into the temporary category or that Infamous term transitory and this would be known as cost push inflation where higher prices are being caused by something on the supply side now monetary policy isn't really well suited for fixing Supply problems and so from a central bank's point of view there's probably not much point in slowing the economy down too much if they can't actually address the core issue it may also be the case that they forecast prices will fall in the medium to long term so they're willing to accept some above Target inflation in the short term while they wait for that to happen now this doesn't mean that they won't take action but it just might come in the form of a slower pace of interest rate Rises or something like that however if inflation runs too high for too long the Central Bank will probably begin to take much bigger action and that brings us on to scenario two so in this scenario headline inflation and core inflation are both running relatively high this could signal that inflation is more broad throughout the whole economy and there's too much demand for goods and services relative to the the lower Supply it could even come as a result of inflation from other areas spilling over into the broader economy things like Energy prices so energy inflation can affect everything in the economy it's not just about the energy that you buy as a consumer being more expensive but also situations like retailers passing on their cost increases can consumers in the form of higher prices so this can sort of broadly push up the prices of things throughout the whole economy and therefore as a result workers are going to start demanding higher wages and again that's going to push up demand even more and it could lead to a situation where we have a wage price spiral which could cause inflation to continue to rise so you can see how the different aspects are interconnected throughout the economy and how inflation in one area can cause a knock-on effect so in this sort of situation inflation would be considered to be much more persistent and the central bank would likely be tightening their policy to try and get it back under control so that would typically mean raising interest rates and slowing economic growth now we've only looked at two broad scenarios there and there could be many other factors to consider like the labor market and so on but you can already begin to see how headline and core inflation can be used together to build a better picture of what's happening in the economy and to anticipate the sort of actions a central bank may take in the future and if you want to understand more about inflation including how it affects the markets for Traders and investors there are other videos on screen now hit the Thumbs Up Button if you found this helpful thanks for watching

Glenn Beck,1.0,iJUQefeMlJI,we have so much on our plate to talk about the one thing we haven't talked about yet is the inflation numbers and it is remarkable joe biden has just come out and said we have zero inflation this month wow we did it we did it we solved it we did we did so that we can start printing more money we have zero inflation the news that came out today relative to the economy actually i just want to say a number zero euro today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of july that's weird yeah zero percent because that's not how that means well the price of some things go up went up last month the price of other things went down by the same amount so we have zero results zero inflation last month now zero that's incredible there and it's interesting because every single publication is is reporting the number as 8.5 right now but that's very close to zero very close to zero now i want to be clear to show you how disingenuous this person is this is how he's come to this conclusion okay okay because people are saying oh he's lying and he's not quite lying this is what he's doing okay now every single time we talk about inflation we talk about it as an annual number right right that is how we talk about it year to year yes everybody talks about it the same way 8.5 is the headline annual number that's the number that everyone has been talking about which everyone focuses on so what he's done is take that number and ignore it completely then he's converted what he's looking at from the headline number to the core number now there's two different measures of inflation basically the core number takes out food and takes out energy to summarize it so that number was uh 5.9 i believe it was this uh this which is zero which is which is i don't know if it's closer than 8.5 but one of the two they're both very close to zero right now you gotta scale from one to a billion five some might as well call it zero right we're just sure so he's ignored the main number he's presented only the core number which has been lowered the entire time and then he's instead of taking the annual measure he's done only the month-to-month measure now no one the the month-to-month measure is not the number that anyone talks about and to be clear it was only supposed to be 0.2 so what he's saying is now that's almost zero anyway that's what everyone was expecting it to be was 0.2 percent instead it was 0.0 percent and he's out there bragging and saying oh well this shows there's no inflation month to month so he's ignored the main measure and he's basically taking the secondary core measure and divided it by 12 even though that's not exactly how they come up with the number and he's saying that there's been no inflation now this is entirely disingenuous and what i've said before on this program on stew does america as well we are very close to one of the most annoying things you're ever going to experience which is this main number that everyone's talking about 9.1 percent is going to start getting lower and when that happens the administration is going to brag about it however this is important this is important what most people will say when you when you say to him hey inflation last month was 9.1 percent and this time it's 8.5 most people will say first of all it's going down that's going to be their initial reaction okay it's going down and because most people will say that the administration is going to brag about it going down secondarily you will think it's month to month well yeah that's the annual measure but it's two separate months measuring most people will say okay so if something was a hundred dollars a year ago uh it was 109.00 last month and now it's 108.50 right it's coming down a little bit it's important to know that's not how this number works the number works based on a year to year measure so they're comparing july to the previous july the reason why i'm saying these numbers are going to come down and everyone's going to be saying well we're past peak inflation the reason why that's going to happen is because the new numbers follow me on this the new numbers are building on old numbers that were already inflated so you're not going in you're not you're not measuring it from a hundred 100 you're measuring it from 108. right so what is the increase of 108. right so let me give you this this is a real world example this is actually what happened okay if you bought something in july 2020 at 100 okay okay in july 2021 inflation was at 5.4 percent so that was costing you 105 dollars and 40 cents okay this new number which is an eight well it's down so i should pay you'd think 103 103 or 104 right no it's up 8.5 from 105.40 so the new number the thing that used to cost a hundred dollars two years ago now costs and fourteen dollars and thirty six cents so your prices are doesn't sound down eighteen percent that's the inflation number from our normal prices fourteen point three six percent and the administration is going to spend all day bragging about that and it is and you're going to go into the store and you say wait a minute these prices aren't any lower they're all higher in fact they're 14 higher on average and you will be right and they will be bragging about it that's the rest of your day everybody boys and girls get together and realize these idiots are gonna come out here and say this all day because they think you are so stupid you just might believe it and they know they're lying and they're going to do it anyway that's the rest of your day average people don't know that and they know it they know it they know it the average person has no idea that what cost a hundred dollars last year was 108 and today because of the inflation you go up from the 108. it's not it's not going back towards 100 it's adding when they say 2 percent inflation is our target that means prices always go up every year by two percent that means your dollar is becoming that's why something cost a dime you know in 1940. i want that uh beautiful cadillac over there all right dollar and a half now it's 185 000 all inflation that's inflation because it continues to add on top of each other
Money & Macro,1.0,VEZsgAgYDhw,"Inflation is back. On that, basically everybody agrees. However, an intense debate is currently raging about whether or not inflation is here to stay or whether it is just a temporary blip. The position that inflation is high now but will soon return to its normal level is championed by team transitory. This team consists of heavy hitters such as U.S. treasury secretary Janet Yellen, ECB president Christine Lagarde, and Nobel prize winning economists Joseph Stiglitz. On the other side of the field, we have team persistent which beliefs that elevated levels of inflation are here to stay and might even increase in the near future. It is represented by prominent economists such as Larry, central bankers like the ex-president of the German Bundesbank Jens Weidman, and very very vocally by investors such as Peter Schiff. But, who should you believe? Hi, I am Joeri and to help you make sense of it all. I will first go over the basics of inflation. Then, I will summarize what might be causing it. And, then, for each cause, why team transitory & team permanent believe what they believe. What's more, for each cause, myself and UK academic, YouTuber and well known rebel of the economics profession Unlearning Economics, will evaluate the evidence and also the case made by team transitory and team permanent. Okay, let's quickly review the basics. Inflation is a simultaneous increase in ALL prices in the economy. So, this does not mean that all prices have gone up by the same magnitude. It just means that, on average, prices have gone up. This sounds straightforward in theory. However, in practice, inflation is insanely difficult to measure. After all, to measure average prices you would have to keep record of the size and price of each transaction in the economy. In most economies, this is not possible since privacy laws prevent economists from going through your bank records. And even if they could, it is surprisingly difficult to determine what has been purchased just from bank records. If you don't believe me, just have a look at one of friends bank account statement from last month and try to figure out what they purchased. To get around these problems, economists have constructed a basket of goods & services that is supposed to represent what a household spends on average. This is the consumer price index or CPI for short. For each good or service, the CPI basket not only consists of a price but also of a weight that reflects how much important this good or service is for households on average. For example, since average households spend a lot on rent but not on supporting this channel via Patreon, an increase in rent prices will affect the CPI a lot whereas me increasing the prices of my Patreon tiers will not. So, what are these weights? Well, as you can see here, in the USA and Europe weights are fairly similar. The bulk of household expenses go to housing costs as well as to food and transportation. Notably though, us lazy Europeans spend quite a bit more on recreation. However, when comparing inflation in Europe and the States one notable difference is the inclusion of house prices. Controversially, neither the European nor the American CPI includes house prices directly, I know, this sounds absolutely mad since house prices have gone through the roof in both areas..., Importantly, house prices have risen much faster than rents, which are included in the CPI. However, you can't just include house prices in the CPI for two reasons. The first is that a house is not just used for 'consumption.' It is also used as an investment. and the dynamics of consumption and investment goods are very different. Simply put you ... as a consumer would not be very happy if the price of a consumption good like .. I don't know graphics cards... goes up... But, if you invested in, say, Gamestop stocks, and its price went through the roof you would be very very happy. The second reason why you can't just include house prices is that the price of a house is not the same as what it costs you. The main reason for this is that most people borrow to buy a house. For example, I just bought a house at a price that was much higher than my parents did. However, I borrowed at close to a 1% interest rate while my parents borrowed at 8%. You'd have to take that into account in the CPI. To deal with these problems, in 1983, the Americans added a new category to the CPI called owner's equivalent rent. Owner's equivalent rent gets around these problems by just asking home owners a simple question: “If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?” The idea here is that, if house prices go up like crazy, owner equivalent rent will go up. But, if mortgage interest rates go down at the same, as they have in both Europe and the USA, owner equivalent rent will rise far slower than house prices.. As you can imagine, this measure is not perfect. However, it is better than leaving it out like the Europeans. After all, how much does rent say if, like in the Netherlands, roughly 69% of people are home owners rather than renters So, in Europe it could very well be that inflation was actually a bit higher than reported since house prices and maintenance costs have gone up like crazy whereas interest rates have gone down a little bit. So, with these weights known, to calculate CPI, economists simply retrieve an average price for everything in the basket, and multiply it by their respective weights. To then calculate yearly inflation, all economists need to do is look at changes in CPI. Simple right? Wellll, not really, because CPI weights have one big problem and that is that they change over time. After all, if the CPI was calculated in 1910, there was a likely a significant weight on the price candles. However, the weight for the price of internet would be non-existent. Therefore, economists update the CPI weights every so often. However, here the pandemic & lockdowns caused a big problem by completely changing consumer behaviour in an instance. At the same time, the CPI weights had already been determined at the start of the 2020. Simply put, in 2020 households started buying far more goods and far fewer services. This pushed up the price of goods more than it made the price of services drop. At the same time, this drastically increased the number of goods people consumed but not their weight in the CPI. Therefore, actual inflation in 2020 was likely quite a bit higher than official inflation. Taking this into account, research by Harvard professor Cavalla estimated that official CPI in the US likely was likely 0.8% too low. This can partially explain why we see such shocking inflation numbers today. But, then the question becomes, by how much? Well, according to my own calculations, if Cavalla was right, US inflation this year would only have be 5.3% rather than the reported 6.2%. While that is still a very high number, it does demonstrate that we shouldn't just take headline inflation numbers and run with them to produce sensationalist YouTube videos. Another reason is that lockdown also messed up the service price data collection. For example, while they were closed, restaurants did not technically have a price. This means that while the fundamental factors driving these prices, such as wages and food prices, might have continued to rise, the economists measuring CPI weren't able to see that in restaurant prices because they weren't being posted. Therefore, they just assumed these prices remained the same that year. While I couldn't find an estimate for how big this effect was. However, it does mean that inflation in 2020 was likely even more understated and thus inflation today is even more overstated. The combination of these two effects has been dubbed: base effects. Base effects are mostly emphasized by team transitory in an attempt to re-assure us that current high inflation numbers will drop once Covid stops messing with the statistics. ""inflation collapsed last year when lockdowns were imposed, which is creating strong base effects as activity recovers"" That being said, some of us are again in a lockdown and many are still afraid to go to restaurants or to travel. So, it could be that inflation is still understated today. Or, even if current headline numbers are overstated thanks to base effects, both team transitory and team permanent do agree that inflation still very high today. So, the debate is still on! But, before we can assess both positions, we need to do a quick recap of the three ways that inflation can come about. But first, if you are watching this video, it likely means that you are intrinsically motivated to understand inflation and willing to recognize how complex this problem really is. So, if that is you, I am happy to report that the sponsor of this video has an economist \ Treasurer job opportunity for you. For the economist part, you will be asked to figure out how to create a global stable coin that is stable... but not backed by a single fiat currency such as the Dollar. For the Treasury part you will be asked to get hands on and manage a portfolio of assets that aligns with that goal. Now, I honestly believe that this is a very unique and interesting job because I had an open and critical conversation about the project and its purpose with Reserve's CEO Nevin Freeman. I've linked to the highlights of that conversation in the description of this video and there you will find more information about the job and how to apply to it. To understand what causes inflation, economists typically use the age old concepts of supply and demand. However, for a macroeconomic concept such as inflation, they use total, also known as aggregate, supply and demand. You see, if aggregate demand rises faster than aggregate supply, average price will rise. And if aggregate supply rises faster than aggregate demand, prices will fall. Now, what is nice about this framework is that helps us to better understand inflation by breaking the problem down into smaller pieces. For example, if aggregate demand rises faster than aggregate supply, economists classify this as demand-pull inflation. On the other hand, if aggregate supply falls but aggregate demand remains the same they call this supply-push inflation. Now hold on, let me just interrupt you writing an angry comment that the internet told you that inflation is caused by money printing. We will get to this under the demand pull inflation section. But, first, let's address the supply chain disruptions that both camps agree on is a major source of inflation today. Both teams recognize that we have seen a perfect supply-push inflation storm these last few months. The first big contributor this this has been a massive energy crisis. One part of this story are flooded coal mines in china and fires near oil fields in Canada. Another part of the story is that certain princes in Saudi Arabia have turned off the oil tap and certain presidents have turned off the gas tap for political reasons. But there is also just an energy sector that hadn't invested for a long time because energy prices had been so low for so long. Then, Global Covid Lockdowns have contributed in two ways. First, they have shut down production in countries affected. For example, very recently a renewed shutdown in Malaysia, where a lot of the world’s chip testing and packaging is done, has reduced chip production by so much that it forced Ford to suspend its U.S. production of the F-150 trucks. The second effect of Covid lockdowns has been to disrupt global supply chains by, for example, shutting down ports in China. In a global supply chain that ran on maximum efficiency but minimal buffers, this has greatly driven up transport prices. And on top of that it slowed down production, and contributed to global supply push inflation even more. By how much you might ask? Well, in all honesty that is very difficult to properly estimate. But, just to get an idea, researchers from the Bank for International Settlements have recently estimated that, without supply disruptions, inflation would have been at least 2.8 and 1.3% lower in the USA & Europe respectively. And you know what ... even Larry Summers from team permanent recognizes that: ""Annual inflation last month, according to core-CPI was above 10%. The majority of that is surely transient"" For a large part the disagreement is just about how temporary supply chain disruptions will last. Here, the position of team permanent is best captured by the following quote from German central banker Jens Weidman: ""The supply-side bottlenecks of the kind we are seeing for semiconductors might turn out to be more persistent. In addition: if we want to meet the climate targets, there will be no getting around significantly higher carbon prices. That will drive energy prices for many years."" On the other hand, team transitory members like ECB president Christine Lagarde have stated that they believe supply bottlenecks to end early next year. Although that quote was before the emergence of the new Covid variant. The most extreme position taken by members of team transitory is best captured by the analogy of the bottleneck economy from the Financial Time's Martin Sandbu. He thinks that our current supply chain situation could be comparable to a ketchup bottle where we are shaking and shaking .. but no products are coming out, thanks to backed up supply chains... but as we speak big manufacturers are building new factories and containers all over the world... and once these are done The product ketchup might come out all at the same time... leading to potentially severe supply-push deflation. To a certain extend this has already happened with Lumber and Steel... which were huge concerns for inflation at the start of the pandemic but have since come down in price. So, UE what do you think about the supply chain push effect and which team is more right than the other team? Well generally speaking I do think that supply chains are something we need to be worrying about when we are talking about inflation. Looking at specific goods and sectors and how they are affected by things, whether it is the pandemic or not, is really important and that is especially true for things like energy, which you have been discussing, which underpin the entire economy. So, I do think that this is the right place to look. In terms of whether this is going to permanent or transitory. It seems to me that a lot of this has been affected by the pandemic and these are going to be transitory factors, most of which are going to go away. But, I will say that with one possible caveat which you raised which I think is going to be very important. If we see further disruptions due to climate change and if we see government shifting away from non-renewable energy, not in a smooth fashion. Then, we might see further problems and those can have an effect on the rest of the economy. So, energy is definitely the one to watch for the future. But, in terms of the immediate danger, I don’t think there is too much to worry about. Yeah, alright, fair enough. I think that I broadly agree with that. The one thing that I would like to add. The one thing that I would like to add is that, I was quite confident about the effects of lockdowns going away. But, with the vaccines efficacy waning a little bit and with Delta being much more ravaging, especially in emerging market economies where a lot of these factories are. It will obviously also be transitory in the long-run. But, it might actually take quite a bit longer than we expected. Yeah, I think it is important to caveat that transitory basically means for as long as the pandemic and lockdown persist. So, you are right you know. Not enough is being done so that globally, we move past the pandemic as much as possible. And when it comes to the energy one, I also broadly agree with you and see the concern of Jens Weidman specifically about this actually taking longer. But, I did also read some interesting articles. From Adam Tooze for example, whom you might know. Stating that the climate change factor is a bit overblown. And what they cite is that after the Paris agreement there was not really a lot less investment into fossil fuel industries and that it could also be a consequence of energy prices dropping significantly in 2015 I think it was and that this industry is super cyclical right. So, that investment not being done then might still reverberate today and that we might actually rather quickly see a reversal of fortunes there. What do you think of that one. Yeah, I haven’t read that Tooze article. But, that sounds sensible to me. I would say certainly it is about how the transition is managed. As long as there aren’t too many sudden changes, we should be able to cope with the transition. And as long as there is enough investment in renewable energy to replace the non-renewables then it shouldn’t be a problem. But, I think it is definitely something to keep an eye on. Now, what happens if people try to buy so much stuff that an economies production just can't keep up? That's right.. Demand-pull inflation. And you know, this is the one that gets both teams really worked because these millionaires and billionaires are just really concerned about the fate of the lower & middle classes of course. For example, investor Peter Schiff from team permanent typically stresses the dangers of giving money to people who don't produce anything, this is what happened under Covid we were expanding the money supply at the same time people were not working. People were leaving their jobs. They weren't being productive. They weren't producing goods. They weren't producing services. Yet the Federal reserve flooded the economy with new money. And so, even though people didn't work, they were spending more money than they did when they were still employed. And so you have all this money chasing a declining goods and services. And so prices are exploding. And he typically argues that the resulting inflation will come at the expense of the middle class. After all, they spend a large fraction of their income the goods & services that will be affected by inflation. At same time, Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz from team transitory argues that more demand than supply is actually good for the working & middle class because it increases wages. ""So, you are absolutely right, I'm welcoming this tight labor market. The only time United States has succeeded in including marginalized groups into the labour force, reducing inequality is when we have a very tight labour market"" This contradiction may seem confusing at first until you realise they are talking about different channels of demand-pull inflation. You could say that Schiff is talking about the money printing channel & Stiglitz about the overheating labour market channel. Let's tackle the one that the internet loves the most first: money printing. To view money printing as the source of all price inflation actually has a very long tradition in economics. The most prominent economist to support this idea was Nobel prize winner Milton Friedman (11:49) who said that. ""The reason we have inflation in the United States, or for that matter anywhere in the world, is because these pieces of papers and the accompanying book entry or their counterparts in other nations are growing more rapidly than the quantity of goods and services produced"" His thinking was inspired by one of the most famous equations in economics and that is the Quantity Theory of Money which states that Money * Velocity of Money = Prices * Quantities. This equation is true by definition... you can see this by looking at the following example.. If in an economy there were 2 dollars, and these exchanged hands once, and there were two loafs of bread in the economy, then we can deduce that the price of each bread was 1 dollar. Now, in itself, this equation is an accounting identity which means that it only tells us that there can be a relationship between these variables. But, it doesn't tell us what that relationship will be. Crucially, Friedman inspired economists often assume that velocity and production are roughly constant. Remember that clip from Peter Schiff arguing that stimulus checks for people at home would be inflationary? Crucially, he made the implicit assumption there that this didn't prevent a further collapse of production. If the money supply is increased while velocity and production stay roughly the same, this new money will lead to an increase in average demand and so prices will go up. Then it makes sense to say ""Everything is getting more expensive. And if people think that is transitory, it is because they don't understand the problem. In fact, they don't even understand inflation or where it comes from because inflation is about money. You are inflating the money supply. That's what's being expanded and none of this is transitory because these deficits aren't transitory. The money printing isn't transitory. It's here to stay. — and that means prices are going to continue to go up because we continue to destroy the value of the dollar as we expand the supply"" Sounds pretty convincing right? However, the monetary theory of inflation has almost completely disappeared from universities. Why? Well, because the data doesn't support this simple explanation in most economies. For example, check out this graph of the CPI for Europe and compare it to the graph of central bank printed M1 money supply... You can clearly see that the money supply has accelerated while price growth has slowed. To a less extend this disconnect also exists for the USA But, if you really want to see this simple theory fail, you only need to look at Japan. Even if we take into account the more expansive M3 money supply measure, which include money created by private banks, and compare it to the CPI. You can clearly see that while M3 kept going up, the CPI had its ups and downs. What can explain this disconnect? Using the quantity theory of money framework, it must mean that either production has increased or velocity has slowed down or a little bit of both of course. If velocity indeed slowed, this means people saved money rather than spent it and this should be reflected in higher asset prices or lower interest rates. Indeed, in Europe and Japan, we have seen falling interest rates and rising asset prices. At this point, members of team permanent might say that okay okay... But, people will start spending all of that money at some point and then cases will truly explode. But, again if we look at Japan, they have been waiting for almost 30 years now. So team permanent should come up with an explanation, why would people suddenly start spending all their money? The only explanation I could find is one made by economists Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, if I pronounce that correctly. They say that as people got older they were saving for retirement. But, as many countries are now ageing, the elderly should start switching from saving to spending more.. however, Japan is again a problem because here this didn't happen ... However, they argue that Japan is unique because many Japanese companies moved production facilities abroad to neighbouring countries that didn't really have this ageing problem. As the world in total gets older, this would not be possible anymore. But, okay that is the future. What about inflation today? Because let's face it, saying that increases in the money supply don't ALWAYS push up prices does not mean that they NEVER push up inflation. And indeed, even members of team transitory, such as Joseph Stiglitz recognize that by giving new money to the poorest, US government support has likely contributed to inflation. However, he says this is temporary because ""The fiscal support is coming to an end and I am firmly off the believe that it is the fiscal support that's made the most difference"" So, two questions that I want to discuss here with Unlearning Economics: (1) how important is the monetary factor? and (2) how likely is it that governments will continue stimulating the economy ... ? Alright UE, what do you think about these two points? Well, I think the monetary factor is perhaps more indirect than people like Peter Schiff have thought. But, perhaps than economists in general have thought for the past few decades. If you look at the effects of interest rates on business decisions. It actually seems to be rather small. The economist Nathan Tankers has written quite a lot on this. And, I think that what you have seen really over the last few decades. Especially in the USA and also in the UK is that the back of the labour movement has been broken. And so what you’ve had is a decline in union density and that people like Paul Volcker, who were obsessed with unions, you’ve seen actually that wage growth has been relatively subdued even with low unemployment. And so I think that has played a big role. Perhaps more so than monetary factors. And so, I think that people end up overstating the role of monetary policy. And especially with someone like Peter Schiff, what you get is, he is almost defining inflation as an increase in the money supply. While of course that is not what inflation means. What inflation means is the increase in prices which may or may not result in the increase of the money supply. And you know we are just not seeing the kind of increase in prices that people like him are predicting. Yeah. You know this is actually interesting because a lot of people often tell me this in my comment section as well. They say that inflation is actually an increase in the money supply. And then I looked it up and apparently this was the old definition of inflation in the early 20th century. I totally agree with you that it is very confusing to mix up old definitions with new definitions. Absolutely and I mean that definition of inflation has some use because we need to understand what is happening to the money supply. Eh why are people worried about inflation? Well I don’t think the aggregate M2 measure of the money supply is really of much concern to most people. I think they are worried about prices and wages and about how those things affect them. So, I think that whatever you want to call it, maybe we can call it something else. But, we are not seeing the rise in price that people like Peter Schiff are predicting. And what do you think of using the Quantity theory of money in general? In this type of context. Is it still useful? Well, this is a big debate, isn’t it. I am of the opinion that is has probably done more harm than good. Which isn’t the same as saying that it can have absolutely no use. But generally speaking I think it overstates the degree that the central bank has on the money supply that is actually in circulation. By itself the quantity theory of money doesn’t do this. But, it has led to these kinds of overstatements. And you saw this with targeting the money supply. They tried that, based largely on reasoning of the quantity theory of money, and it didn’t really work. and just more generally, I think the mechanism from central bank actions into financial markets and an expansion of the money being used in circulation. That mechanism is much weaker than we think. Therefore, I don’t think that increase in M therefore increase in P Y is a very reliable mechanism. Yeah, right, I totally agree and I think most academic economists also agree and that is basically why they stopped using the quantity theory of money that much. Because especially when you look at velocity that has just totally been fluctuating wildly and it and it seems that a lot of money that used to be chasing goods and services is finding its way to financial markets. Therefore, leading financial market inflation and not regular inflation, right? Absolutely, you mentioned the definition of inflation as too much money chasing too few goods and services right. Or you alluded to it. Which I think is the common definition of inflation, which is a good starting point, as is the quantity theory of money. But, as you said and as we discussed earlier with supply chains, it might be a good idea to look at the specifics. What is going on in supply chains? What is going on in the labour market? What is going on in financial markets and things like that to get a better understanding of inflation? Yeah okay. Excellent. Well, that leads us to a nice Segway into the next section, which is about the labour markets and still the demand pull angle but then from the Philips curve perspective. But, before we get into that, what do you think about fiscal stimulus in particular? Do you think it will reverse or do you think it will remain fairly loose? I am cautiously optimistic about this and I have actually been very surprised by the extend to which have expanded social insurance. I mean, in the USA, where of course us Europeans always like to take the piss out of them for not having a very good welfare state. They have actually seen poverty decline during the pandemic. And you see Biden coming to office and he seems to be quite keen to expand spending, you know, in areas like care and renewable energy as well as the typical infrastructure. And in the UK you have seen Rishi Sunak with a fairly moderate but expansionary budget recently. So, I am quite cautiously optimistic about this. Perhaps it has changed our relationship with government spending. Because you don’t see people worrying about the debt anymore. And they have seen you know governments can do things. They can do more than we had thought and the money is available. And the money is available. And as a European I would like to add that weirdly the European Union has also not gone into full austerity mode just yet. One thing that I do notice when you say this, what I find interesting, is that when you say okay I am cautiously optimist about, that might cause some inflation, and there might be some inflationary pressures from that, especially in the USA. That is than an argument for team permanent somewhat from this side, right, if I hear that correctly. So if governments continue spending it might increase inflation. But actually this relates to a bit of a broader point to how we think about inflation. There is a resurgence of, we can call it, supply side leftism or something like that right? The notion that in spending money, perhaps by expanding capacity in renewable energy for example. Governments can actually expand the supply side as well as the demand side and therefore we might see growth without necessarily excessive inflation. I am willing to believe that inflation might rise to 3-4%. But, in terms of too much inflation, as long as the government spending is oriented on the supply as well as the demand side, I don’t see that happening. Okay, so just to tie that into the Quantity theory of money before we move on, that is an argument, where you are saying well Q (products) will be rising partly from an increase in M from government spending, right? Yeah exactly, exactly and this is one of the things with the quantity theory of money right. If everything is changing at once and not independently. Then, it becomes less useful as a guide to policy. Yeah, yeah, totally agreed. Okay, now, let's put a different spin on the demand-pull inflation channel. Are there any non-monetary ways that overall demand might outpace overall supply? Yes, the theory of inflation that is most popular in universities is related to the Philips curve. The Philips curve plots the relationship between unemployment and inflation. The idea behind this is that if unemployment is low the economy is running close to or at its full capacity. This means that workers have a lot of money to spend and that not much more can be produced. So, while wages are likely to rise with labour in such high demand... aggregate supply cannot keep up and thus we will see demand-pull inflation. If this is true, we should now see signs of an overheating economy, labour shortages ... trucker shortages and what not. But, do we? Let's have a look at the evidence... Both in Europe and the United States, the unemployment rate shot up at the start of the pandemic and then came back almost to the low rates that we saw before the pandemic... when there really wasn't a lot of inflation. So, that is not particularly alarming. However, unemployment rates might not tell the full story here because they only include people who are actively looking for a job. It could be that very well be that workers don't feel like returning to the w"
SciBRIGHT,1.0,xaXCTeDF_aY,"If you look at this graph of where I live, New Zealand’s inflation over the past 10 years is suddenly heading upwards, but if we zoom out from 1920 to the present, you’ll see this isn’t the highest it’s ever been. And on a global level, most countries have seen inflation skyrocketing too. But was do headlines of inflation being 7.3% actually mean? What is inflation, and why is it happening? Inflation in a sense is the decrease in purchasing power, meaning your dollar won’t go as far as it used to. Inflation can be a concern, with your saved money being less valuable over time, but gradual inflation in an economy is expected with most countries having a target of around 2% annually. As businesses grow, more workers are hired, unemployment falls and households have more money to spend - inflation is a natural side effect of economic expansion. When we hear that inflation is up X percent, this is typically on an annual level, comparing year over year. Fixed baskets of goods made up from typically around 11 groups, ranging from food and education costs, to healthcare and transport, are tracked to see the changing prices of good over time and provides a measure of inflation. The cause of inflation is often up for debate among economists, but there are two primary types of inflation from Keynesian economic theories which are fairly widely recognised but still debated: cost-push inflation and demand-pull inflation. Cost-push Cost-push inflation occurs when production costs increase but the demand for goods does not change. Production costs are mostly made up of the four factors of production, land, labour, entrepreneurship and capital. Cost-push inflation sees the added costs of a companies underlying inputs into their production getting passed on to consumers. Examples of what can cause this are natural disasters, which can reduce the amount of raw materials. Low unemployment rates - due to employers having to raise wages to attract talent - which is what is currently occurring in many job sectors. Or commonly used commodities such as semiconductors, oil and metal prices rising which are used in most major production pipelines. Government regulation changes can also cause cost-push inflation, for example, new mandates, such as hypothetically “all employees must have healthcare” or tax increases causing production prices to increase as it is an added cost for companies to have to compensate for. Demand-pull Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is high consumer demand, but not enough supply. Unlike cost-push which is influenced from factors of production, demand-pull is influenced by the four factors of the macroeconomy: households, businesses, governments and foreign buyers. This sees these four sectors essentially bidding prices up, competing to purchase a limited amount of goods. Economists describe demand-pull in a sentence as, ”too many dollars chasing too few goods”. Because demand is outpacing supply, prices go up. Stimulus checks can be seen as a recent example where demand-pull inflation could be happening, as too much money can end up going towards too few goods. Demand-pull inflation is also linked to low unemployment levels, which is a positive thing, but leads to more people having disposable income to spend, but production may not be able to initially keep up with this. Inflation can be controlled by a country's central bank raising the interest rate it charges on loans and advancements to commercial banks, which in turn gets passed on to us. By raising it, the goal is to slow down the economy, because higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs meaning people are likely to spend less - which sees the demand for goods and services fall. Different countries have different terms for this rate, with New Zealand and Australia having Official Cash Rate, the US having Federal Funds Rate and UK having the official bank rate. What’s behind current inflation? The current inflation we’re seeing is primarily due to two factors, the pandemic and then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the issue. Over the start of the pandemic, tens of millions across the world lost their jobs, with companies cutting jobs or having to shut down factories due to restrictions, and consumers stayed home due to lockdows, causing sales to plummet. This didn’t last long though, and consumers were back out shopping and spending money but businesses were struggling to meet this sudden demand with them not being able to hire quick enough, seeing global supply chains across the world fall apart.. With cargo ships stuck in ports with a lack of workers, high demand and general shortages, the price of gasoline is a great example of something which has skyrocketed and also caused things such as food, airfares and general goods to rise in prices too, due to them being reliant on fuel. Stimulus packages around the world have also been linked to adding to part of current inflation levels, adding to the issues with excessive demand compared to available goods post initial lockdowns - basically introducing a sudden influx of hundreds of billions of dollars chasing too few goods. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimates that stimulus packages in America may have added three percentage points to America’s current national inflation rate. While Russia’s economy is pretty small, its commodities are pretty significant for the world. Sanctions on Russian oil has seen supply get constrained. Ukraine also produces a large amount of crops, which with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has seen this supply dwindle, causing a lack of goods and prices to rise. Thanks for watching."

Bitcoin Max,1.0,Bx3njJl-13s,tomorrow could be a very important day for the financial markets in the morning we're going to be receiving brand new cpi data that could give us a hint on where we're heading with inflation and the fed what is cpi cpi is the consumer price index basically it just measures how expensive is it to be an american right now it's an index that averages the costs of most things that americans are going to need from day to day now it's important to understand that there's two different types of cpi there's just the normal cpi which tracks everything and then there's core cpi core cpi takes out food and energy because both of those sectors can be affected by seasonality so they think it's just a little bit more accurate with core cpi what's actually happening when it relates to inflation the reason that this is important for the financial markets is because they're going to react to whatever number comes out tomorrow if it's higher than the last cpi print you can pretty much expect that the markets are going to crash across the board because that means that inflation is still rising and it means that the fed is going to have to be aggressive with their interest rates the cpi print that comes out tomorrow could be crucial in determining where we head from here in the financial markets subscribe to my channel and check out part two of this video

Rob Berger,1.0,MlSkdslNZVc,everybody welcome back to the financial freedom show my name is rob berker in today's video we're going to take a look at tips versus eye bonds tips treasury inflation protected securities and eye bonds they're both bonds that help us hedge the risk of inflation but they're very very different from one another so here's what we're going to do first we're going to start with the similarities we're going to look at five ways uh in which they're they're very similar then we're going to look at eight ways they're different and the differences are really important to understand and then we're going to finish up i'm going to walk through a couple of my own thoughts on the differences and how i'm using or not using them in my own portfolio and then as a bonus tip at the end i'm going to talk about how we can use one of them if we want to to help save for child's education there are some tax advantages built into one of them so let's get started and uh with the similarities number one is they're both bonds issued by the us government so that means there's effectively no what's called credit risk that is risk of default or at least it's about the safest thing we have access to today so they're both issued by the u.s government that's the first thing the second similarity is they do both hedge or protect us against unexpected increases in inflation that's kind of the reason we might want to invest in either a tips or an ipod they protect us from inflation now as we'll see in a minute they protect us in different ways but they do both hedge against inflation and the third thing and related to that is they both use the consumer price index technically the cpi for all urban consumers the cpi-u that's the index they use for their adjustments based on inflation again we'll look at that in a little more detail in just a minute um the fourth similarity is they both can be purchased through treasury direct let me just show you that briefly treasury direct is the part of the federal government the federal government website treasurydirect.gov we'll look at it again in just a minute but you can purchase both tips and i bonds directly from the federal government through treasury direct it's not the only way you can buy tips as we'll see in a minute but you can you can buy them both through treasury direct and then the the fifth similarity is they're both exempt uh from state and local taxes so they have a tax benefit as well when you get your interest payments as small as they may be they are exempt from state and local taxes so those are five similarities let's go right to the differences because that's really where some important things come to light the first is how we buy now i mentioned just a minute ago you can buy them both through treasury direct but here's the deal that's effectively the only way to buy eye bonds you can't buy eye bonds through say an etf or a mutual fund they're not sold on what's called the secondary market you have to buy them directly from the federal government tips on the other hand are traded on the secondary market and so you can for example invest in an etf a tips etf or mutual fund vanguard offers them most of the major mutual fund uh companies offer them so in that sense tips are frankly a little easier to buy than i bonds and that has some implications as we'll see in just a minute now related to that the second difference is the purchase limits when you buy an i-bond you're limited to ten thousand dollars in i bonds a year when you buy them directly through treasury direct you know if you're married both spouses can can buy ten thousand dollars in eye bonds but but you're limited in that regard now you can boost that a little bit if you get a refund each year you can use up to five thousand dollars of your refund to buy eye bonds as well so i guess that would bring your total to fifteen thousand but the key really is that with ibonds there is a limit uh to how much you can buy each year with tips as a practical matter for you and i there's really no limit at all technically if you're an institutional buyer they're going to be limits but for you and i as a practical matter you can buy you know as much in the way of tips as you want so that's the second important difference the third difference is how the two adjust for uh inflation and let's start with eye bonds what ibots do is they have sort of you can think of it as two interest rates they have what they call a fixed rate and then they have what's called an inflation rate the fixed rate is determined when you buy uh the bond and it's uh it stays the same just as you would think fixed it doesn't change so uh right now the fixed rate on an i bond and let me show you this may or may not surprise you it is zero percent we can go all the way up to here we go may of 2021 as you can see they set this every six months in may and november the fixed rate is zero percent now that doesn't sound very good but now we have to look at the inflation rate this two adjusts every six months and based on the cpi and we can see that currently it's 1.77 percent that's the six-month rate so if it stays the same in november you would effectively double that to what 3.54 percent and to calculate your your your interest rate on an ipod you add the fixed rate to the inflation rate so effectively on an annual basis as i record this video uh i bonds are paying just over three and a half percent but again come november uh depending on what the cpi does uh that inflation rate could go up or down you can see over a number of years as you look on the screen here the rates have varied they can even be negative that is a possibility but we'll come back to that that's just uh the inflation rate and i will leave a link to this page uh below the video now uh with uh tips it kind of is the opposite they don't actually change the interest rate what they do is they adjust the principal balance that the interest rate is applied to so if there's inflation the principal balance gets increased and then whatever the the rate is it gets applied to that increased balance if there happens to be deflation and there is from time to time the principal balance goes uh down and that's how they adjust for inflation now one important thing to keep in mind is that with the tip although the principal balance can go up and down with inflation and deflation when the bond matures you'll never get less than the face amount of the bonds even if there's deflation every year you own the tips bond you'll never get back less than you put in so that that's good but you have to understand with tips they adjust for inflation by adjusting the principal balance all right related to all that is the fourth difference and that's the interest rates and i want to go back uh to this tab here and you saw where we have this fixed rate of zero percent currently here it is and we have the current inflation rate of 1.77 but if you come down here you'll notice some negative rates uh this was back in may may 1st of 2015. so here's the deal with i bonds you'll take the fixed rate and you'll add it to the inflation rate and whatever that amount is that's your your rate for the next six months however i bonds will never go negative if the inflation rate is negative and the fixed rate is zero the interest rate applied for that next six month period will just be zero interest rates for i bonds never go below zero with tips the rates can and do and currently are negative and let me just show you an example of that this is a vanguard short term you can see it here inflation protected securities index fund this is tips again remember they can be bought inside an etf for a mutual fund and that's good but if we go down here and we look at what's called the sec yield right here it's the the the basically the income that the fund paid over the 30 day period ending i guess as of july 29th you can see right here it's negative a negative two point four four percent so tips the yields the the interest on them can go negative that's an important thing to keep in mind we'll come back to it as a matter of fact now the fifth difference has to do with taxes with an eye bond you can defer the taxes until either the bond matures or you decide to redeem and and sell your bond back to the u.s government you can defer the taxes until then if you want to with tips you can't interest and principal adjustments are taxed annually which as a general rule makes tips more ideal for tax advantaged accounts than taxable accounts so that's a fifth difference to keep in mind and that brings us to number six and that's the maturity i-bonds have one maturity one length and it's 30 years you can't buy a 10-year i-bond they're all 30 years with tips 5 10 or 30-year maturities so you have you have some choices and for that reason you'll often see funds or etfs that are either short-term tips or intermediate or long-term tips so you have some flexibility there but with i bonds it's just 30 years right number seven there are some penalties and restrictions if you try to sell an i bond that we need to know about so first of all you cannot redeem an i-bond for the first 12 months the government won't bite back from you invest in an i-bond you're stuck with it for 12 months that's the first thing and then the second thing is after the 12 months if you sell it you're going to pay a three-month penalty worth three months worth of interest until you've waited a full five years after five years you can sell it without penalty but if you sell it before five years you're going to get a penalty of three months interest so that's something to keep in mind in some ways it makes it similar to the penalty for a certificate of deposit i personally given the current interest rates that you're getting on an i-bond that three-month penalty doesn't concern me too much because it's still clobbering what you can earn say on a savings account but it's important and it's something to keep in mind as you're making your own decisions on how to invest your money with tips you know there are no similar penalties you can buy and sell tips on the secondary market there are no restrictions like there are with eye bonds now the eighth and final difference is that as you may know particularly if you watch my bonds 101 video as interest rates rise and fall the value of existing bonds go in the opposite direction so if interest rates go up the value of an existing bond would go down if interest rates go down the value of an existing bond goes up however with i bonds remember you can't sell them or buy them you know in the open market you can only exchange with the federal government and the value of the bond basically stays the same if you want to sell your bond your eye bond back to the government you want to redeem it they're going to give you the face value it doesn't matter if interest rates have gone up or down you're going to get whatever the value of the bond is if you own tips and you sell them the actual value there could be they could be selling at a premium or a discount so for example if you think interest rates are going to fall it's kind of hard to believe in the current market they would do that but you know i've been surprised before on interest rates so if they fell the value of an existing bond any bond really but tips would go up so that's something to keep in mind tips values will change as interest rates change value of an i bond won't so those are the eight differences they're pretty significant and now what does that all mean how should we think about all of those differences as we try to think about our own portfolios so a few things to keep in mind when it comes to just asset allocation if you want to allocate something to an inflation protected bond something that's going to hedge against inflation i think is a practical matter tips are probably the answer because they can be bought and sold through etfs and mutual funds if you have a portfolio of any size and you want to allocate 10 20 whatever it might be to an inflation protected bond it's going to be really hard to do that with eye bonds given you have to buy them directly from the government and there are limits on how much you can buy each year tips are just much much easier having said that i personally have moved out of tips i've owned them in the past i just can't stomach the negative rates yes i like the idea of having investments that hedge against inflation but it seems to me an awfully expensive price to pay for that inflation protection and from my perspective stocks are pretty decent hedge against inflation not in the short term in the short term inflation and higher interest rates will clobber stocks but over the long term stocks have historically anyway significantly outperformed inflation so i'm just not a big believer in investing in tips today given the negative yields now with eye bonds can they serve as an emergency fund well again you've got to be able to get over that limit on selling them for 12 months if you can deal with that and how you structure your finances then probably not a bad alternative although frankly a savings account is probably just an easier way to go having said that i do own a little bit in eye bonds and i do plan to buy more this year both for me and my wife we're going to buy the limit of ten thousand dollars because i think the rates are just really good right now and um i do suspect in november the result will be pretty solid rates as well although i guess we'll see so i do have some eye bonds in my portfolio and i am increasing that this year although then again given the limits on how much i can buy it's a really really small fraction of our overall portfolio but such is life there you go now i did promise you a bonus tip and that comes to the question of education it turns out there's some tax benefits if you use i bonds to pay for education this does not apply to tips and let me show you and again i'll leave a link to what i'm showing you below the video this is a page from treasury direct and it walks through how you can use eye bonds to pay for education and avoid taxes uh on the interest now there are a number of sort of hoops you have to jump through they're all right here some of them may surprise you for example this one one of the qualifications up is that you were 24 or older before your savings bond uh was issued and you have to use the proceeds of the bond for education expenses for either yourself your spouse or your dependents and as you can see there are other requirements as well so before you make any decisions it's really important that you understand what these requirements are and that you meet them but i wanted to point that out i bonds can be an effective part of a broader a plan to pay for a child's education so there you go we've got the similarities and the differences and some strategies when it comes to tips versus eye bonds if you have any questions or comments leave them below the video i'll be happy to help you out any way i can and until next time remember the best thing money can buy is financial freedom
CA. VARSHA RAJPUT,1.0,LBjgDBd5qNI,"Parle-G biscuits, which we all have been eating since childhood, are still available for ₹5 and were available for ₹5 in the 90s as well, but despite so much economic inflation, how has its price remained the same? Actually, in the 19th century, the size of the ₹5 packet of Parle-G biscuits was half, 100 grams, which has reduced from 100 to 50 grams today. This is what we call shrink flash. When the company reduces the size, weight or volume of the product without increasing its price, then we call it shrinkage. According to this practice, the size and weight of the product is reduced, it is so minimal and it is made over the year so that you can easily notice this difference.

PensionCraft,1.0,Vh5FmZRjBpo,the UK economy is in a state of low growth and high inflation or stagflation and that's why I bought an inflation-linked Bond so in this video I'll talk about why I did that but also how I did it it wasn't easy and also I'll talk about what I hope the reward is going to be now don't forget if you do enjoy our videos please do like this and also subscribe to our channel that way you won't miss any new ones so let's look at how and why I bought inflation Bonds in a bit more detail let's begin with stagflation in the UK beside me you can see GDP growth in the UK going back to 1955 and notice how it breaks down into two phases the first phase is from 1955 to the global financial crisis where growth averaged 2.4 percent notice after that there was a kind of leg downwards and we never got back to that long-term Trend not only that but the rate of growth also slowed down to 2.1 percent then we got the pandemic which took a big chunk out of GDP but we did bounce back and now it seems to have kind of flounded again if we compare growth with the United States you can see that during the pandemic the US also took a hit but it wasn't as deep as the one in the UK and if you look across G7 the other rich countries of the world the patent that you see is also one of a shallower fall and a more rapid recovery and whereas U.S growth seems to have recovered in the UK it actually seems to have leveled off which is quite worrying turning to inflation if we look at UK inflation relative to other countries ours is now looking quite sticky the latest UK print of inflation as I make this video was 10.1 percent that's above the EU average of 9.9 it's well above Germany France and also the US where disinflation a falling rate of inflation looks to be very clearly the case now in the UK there's a lot of upward pressure on wages at the moment so we look at the real wage growth you can see that there were long periods in the past when wages were falling in real terms after the global financial crisis and we never really recovered from that there was a period of real wage growth after the pandemic which was quite significant but now we've gone back to negative real wage growth if we look at nominal wage growth where we haven't adjusted for inflation what's particularly worrying in the UK right now is that wage growth is very high in nominal terms now that's because of successful wage negotiations but also a very tight labor market as we'll see in a moment now the prospect of a price wage spiral where prices Chase wages and wages Chase prices is actually a material risk in the UK and that's partly because the UK labor Market's very tight the same is true in other countries of course but if we look at the number of vacancies job vacancies per unemployed person that's at a very elevated level in the UK right now it has come off its peak but still remains elevated it I think part of the problem is that if you look at the number of economically active workers in the UK that's this red line that seems to have plateaued so we're not getting any new workers entering the market and yet at the same time the number of jobs the number of available jobs has actually increased upwards very rapidly so we've got a fixed pool of Labor which is static we've got increasing jobs which those workers could do but we can't satisfy that demand for workers so of course having greater demand for workers than supply of workers pushes up the price of Labor and that means in the UK at least that we're going to have an upward pressure on wages and that could make inflation yet more sticky if the economy is in a state of stagflation how can we deal with that as investors well previously I did a video about the investment clock as it's called now all this does is to arrange growth and inflation onto the two axes of this graph so you've got Rising inflation towards the right falling inflation towards the left Rising growth going upwards and falling growth going downwards so we're pretty much in this bottom right quadrant which is stagflation in the UK and in the fixed income space the best place to invest in that kind of environment is an inflation-linked bonds so that's why I decided to buy inflation linked to UK government bonds or guilds and these are also called linkers and this is the inflation linked bond which I bought now you can think of the certificate beside me kind of like a birth certificate which was issued by the UK debt management office it publishes one of these for each of the bonds rigid issues and of course the whole point for the existence of this bond is to raise money for for the treasury in this case it raised 1.5 billion pounds now the birth date of the bond the issue date was October 2012 and the maturity date of the bond when people get their money back that's in March of 2024. in the interim this thing's going to be a very small coupon and the percentage of the face value of the bond which the bond pays every year is just 1 8 of a percent it's absolutely tiny however what's special about this bond is that it's going to be linked to the rate of inflation so notice this reference Index this very large number at the bottom here because that's going to crop up later on it's very important for this Bond so let's pretend initially that this is not an inflation-licked bond this is what the cash flows would look like if that was the case so for a normal guilt what you'd get is you'd pay a hundred pounds for the bond on day one when it's issued this was in 2012 and that was on the issue date of October the 12th 2012 then at maturity on March the 22nd 2024 you get your hundred pounds back and you'd get any final coupon that's paid now between the issue date and the maturity date you're going to get very small coupons these are paid every six months so you get half of that 1 8 so a sixteenth of a percent every six months and a sixteenth of a percent of a hundred is going to be six and a quarter Pence every six months now I only bought this Bond on March the 14th of this year so I'm only entitled to the final one two three four coupons and the return of the principal but you can probably guess the one I'm really interested in is that return of principle because that's the really big cash flow the coupons are almost zero but because this is an inflation linked Bond these are not the cash flows that you actually get and that's because of something magical called uplift the whole point of inflation link bonds is that the principal and the coupons rise in line with inflation and what we care about is the cumulative rate of inflation since the issued date of the bond now it's not CPI inflation which these bonds are linked to there was discussion of moving it to CPI but for now it's still RPI retail price inflation which is also published by the ons the offers for National statistics in the UK and you can see the rate of that year on year going back to before 1990. notice that at the moment it's 13.5 percent which is considerably higher than the 10.1 percent for CPI inflation now to actually work out the amount of uplift how much the cash flows increase over time is not easy it actually comes with a lag so you actually look back three months three calendar months from the date of the cash flow to the value of RPI to work out what the uplift is relative to the date on which the bond was issued now if the cash flow doesn't fall on the first car and a day of a month then you have to do an interpolation which is quite complex but it depends on something called a reference index and that's for the first calendar day of the month in which the day falls for the cash flow and the index for the first calendar day of the next month and you round it to five decimal places so immediately you can see why some people are reluctant to buy inflation-laked bonds they are quite technical but the other key Point here is that for the future cash flows I don't know what I'm going to get if I buy a normal Government Bond and I hold it to maturity I know precisely how much my cash flows will be and precisely when they'll be paid in contrast with an inflation linked Bond you don't know what this reference index is going to be in the future you just got to guess what the rate of inflation will be so in that sense you're kind of Leaping into the unknown if inflation's more than expected then you'll get more money if inflation is less than expected you'll get less but the key point is that whatever inflation is RPI inflation at least it'll be linked to that index now our pension craft Community get access to a range of trackers and one of them is the macroeconomic tracker this is what it looks like and I've recently added several new tabs specifically for the UK so I've now got UK guilt yields those are often difficult to find so if you do buy single nominal government bonds this is the yield you'll lock in and at the moment you can see that those have risen quite sharply for the point of view of linkers the interesting tab is inflation so you can look at UK CPI inflation which you can see is very high you can also look at the tight labor market and employment's very low but if you're going to buy inflation linked bonds something called Break evens are very interesting this tells you what inflation has to average over the life of your bond in order to make an inflation-licked Bond worthwhile in other words what rate of inflation is baked into the price already if you think inflation will exceed that then it's worthwhile investing in an inflation-linked Bond and when I did that for the UK I certainly thought that it probably would be worthwhile so if you want to get access to this and you want to learn more

this Linker then just click on the link in the description below or just go to pensioncraft.com now as I say I don't really know what the rate of inflation is going to be over the remaining life of my bond so this is my guess as to what that return will be so this is the cumulative uplift for my bond since it was issued in 2012. now this Factor starts off at one initially there's no uplift because there was no inflation but then as we get each of these coupons every six months notice how gradually we accumulate greater and greater uplift so the coupons will be gradually increasing such that by the time I bought the bond this was in March of this year the uplift was about 50 percent now if we look at those recent cash flows the rate at which the cash flow has been growing the rate of growth of uplift due to RPI every six months with these numbers so you can see as the rate of inflation soared then we recently reached about seven or six percent annual growth in prices so what I've simply had to do is assume that inflation will decelerate as the bank of England says it will but because it's sticky I think that'll happen quite slowly so my educated guess for the remaining three six-month periods is we're going to get six percent three percent and two percent increase in RPI for every successive six month period is that just a guess yes it is and if that's the case these are the cash flows I'll receive I bought the bond when it had an uplift of about 50 so I paid about 150 and on the Redemption date in about one and a half years I'm going to receive about 166 pounds there'll also be some tiny coupon payments three of them each of them will be about 10 pence plus a final 10 pence coupon on the Redemption date if we combine all those cash flows I'm going to get an internal rate of return of about 7.6 percent which isn't too bad but the critical point is that this will keep up with the rate of inflation in the UK by definition now let's see the actual process of buying a Linker and it was not easy in order to do this I opened an account with interactive investor which offers single guilts but also single inflation linked bonds and I put it inside an item so I don't have to worry about capital gains or income in fact for UK guilts you don't have to pay Capital Gains anyway now while I could buy a guilt via the usual web interface just as you would for a stock or a fund I couldn't do that for my Linker so I actually had to call them up and right now I'm going to show you what that call was like they just basically throw a huge amount of information at you and you've just got to be absolutely clear as to what the price is to expect but the lady that did it was very good I have to say I'll press one to cancel a trade our advisors are working hard to answer your calls as quickly as possible [Music] interactive investor could I start by taking your account number please and how is it I can help today well I was hoping I could buy an index linked Treasury symbol for that please yes of course it's tr24 yes could I buy 5 000 pounds worth please and that'll be attempted to buy or attempting to invest on your behalf five thousand Towers in the um treasury United Kingdom government of 0.125 investing SNR 22nd and 3rd 2024 GBP guilt symbol tr24 and that'll be at Market best um at the web Commission of um 5.99 and if executed that'll be dealt on a two plus two yes please no but you're going to be famous because you were recorded on my YouTube channel so uh congratulations great thank you very much for your help take care bye-bye so if you do agree with me that the UK's in a state of stagflation and likely to stay there for some time then perhaps a Linker would make sense for you too all I'd say is make sure you understand it before you buy it never buy something which you don't understand but also you don't know what you're gonna get because the rate of inflation is unknown in the future now don't forget our offer if you want to join our membership there'll be a link about that in the description below or just go to pensioncraft.com and you get access to chat and lots of members only videos including one at length on how to

"Clark Howard: Save More, Spend Less",1.0,ZHujeMCtZFI,I want to tell you that there's an odd phenomenon going on right now for the money that you want to save and not invest CD rates that are short like a year CD are higher right now than long ones like five year CDs and that's because there's an assumption that inflation is going down and that the interest rates you can earn are going to go down over time so this is really a good time for you to shop around for the best deal on Five-Year CDs knowing that interest rates are likely to be lower a year from now and what you want to look for are five-year CDs that get you as close as you can to five percent that's the magic number you want to lock in
Patrick E. Wynne,1.0,0jxjT-Pq1X0,let's talk about the Federal Reserve exciting the Federal Reserve was founded in 1913 and acts as U.S Central Bank its main purpose is to uphold the U.S banking system to make sure it's sound and resilient the banking system is is strong it is sound it is it is uh resilient take a guess why the Federal Reserve was created Bank runs in 1907 there was a panic a frenzy of withdrawals AKA Bank runs this is all due to the public distrust in the banking system and over a century later we're having Bank runs today hmm the Federal Reserve does a handful of things to affect monetary policy but the number one thing is price stability price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve without price stability the economy does not work for anyone this is the number one concern because the FED seeks to maintain a stable inflation rate they don't want prices going drastically up or drastically down why because a stable inflation rate preserves the purchasing power of your money follow me for more Finance

Uptin,1.0,465sKRS_4M0,"This Big Mac meal here in Turkey costs 33 Turkish lira. That's about $3, $0.41 at today's exchange rate, pretty reasonable for McDonald's. But consider this If you're earning minimum wage here, this meal is going to cost you the equivalent of working more than three hours. But that's just McDonald's. What about other things like everyday items? How many hours of work does it take to afford those one hour, an hour and a half. two hours, two and a half hours, three hours, five hours, one day, one day and a half one week, three weeks, two months, nine months. And if you want to be able to afford this car working minimum wage here, that will take you 31 years. It's actually getting worse and worse. Turkey's currency is falling drastically, but buying power is going down also decreasing. Inflation is soaring. The currency is getting higher, higher, higher. All this means daily life is becoming harder and harder. My money doesn't have any value, and it's people, especially young generation, are frustrated. It's so hard to be a young people. This is literally the worst time to be young person in Turkey. It's hard to live here as a young person. This is a story about so much more than McDonald's or even economics. It's about how people are struggling to make ends meet as their buying power falls and its young generation dreams of a life abroad. Money is worthless, and life in Turkey is worthless. It's so hard to live in Turkey, actually. That's Batikan. He was working at a jewelry store when I met him just six months ago. He was earning $15 per day last year. I earn money $20 for a day, but this year 15. But today he's now earning less than $9 a day. So many young people has no money. They can't drink something. They can't eat some to get out of sight. It's so hard for them. six years ago, if you had 30 Turkish lira, you could exchange that for $10. But now, if you wanted $10, you would need to fork over 100 Turkish lira for the same amount. The currency has plunged more than 30% this year, but even before this year, things were not good. Since 2010 or so, the currency's just gone up. I mean, it just keeps on going up. So it happened like five years ago, where one day it just got to eight, I think not even ten but eight, and that day, the politicians were speaking about something. So that's why it got that high. President Erdogan and the Turkish government, I have a message release Pastor Andrew Brunson now or be prepared to face the consequences. She's referring to a moment when the Turkish lira dropped the most it had in nearly 20 years because of tension between President Trump and Turkey's president. Turkish prison to the White House in 24 hours. That's not bad. I really can't forget that day because at the time, the dollar just like increased a lot and my dad told me that like, we can't afford your college tuition anymore. Since then, the currency began falling as investors globally questioned the country's stability as the Turkish lira becomes weaker and weaker. More people are looking to buy grown products instead of importing from other countries. That's just one way to keep prices stable, and home grown bananas are just one example. So even though I paid twice as much for these bananas, they're actually clearly not as fresh because they were imported from Costa Rica. But I am curious to see which one tastes better, the ones that are from Turkey or the ones that are imported. I honestly didn't think that Turkey had the climate to even grow bananas, so the fact that they're selling home grown bananas is quite interesting. Let's give it a try. This definitely tastes different. But I guess some people, if they can afford it or willing to pay for the imported bananas amidst the currency crisis, inflation here is surging , hitting 20%, which makes everyday prices a lot more expensive. Remember, earlier in the grocery store, imagine working two weeks of your life just to be able to afford this. The thing is that the basic things such as cheese breads. Maybe it's actually got twice off the price of the basic things which you can roll on. Your life got higher. Transportation prices are getting higher for the people who live just everyday life, they're ruining their life even more. One lira means nothing in Turkey now, but pastimes, It had a lot of value like you can buy some stuff with one there, but now it's nothing. They can't buy anything. They can't buy any of the houses, you know the rents. Prices are also getting higher and higher. It was 2000 Turkish Lira per month. This year, it was four or 4.5. So why exactly is all this happening? Turkey's economy is actually growing by a whopping 20% at one point this year, making it the biggest growth compared to any other major country except for China. This happen especially as many of its COVID restrictions were lifted. But if the economy is growing, then what exactly is the problem? Well, you can call that partially, as some economists say, an exchange rate illusion in terms of GDP per capita, turkey has dropped 40% over the past eight years. During COVID, its government was helping a lot of businesses and citizens pumping a lot more money into the economy. This is partially why its currency is weakening and inflation is soaring. Turkey has a big economy. It's the 20th largest economy in the world. But when you divide that by its massive population size, it becomes number 91. See, usually to slow down inflation, economists say you should raise interest rates, you know, to keep the amount of money limited. But despite what's happening, Turkey's central bank's most recent move was to cut interest rates, hoping to encourage investment. I think it's because of the politics right now. Everybody is just thinking about money nowadays, but if it changes, it has to be like that. Politics should change, and after that, money would change and after that, everybody will get better. Turkey's president has fired the head of its central bank multiple times in just a few years. There have been four governors now raising concern about any sustainable plan. Surely because of the decisions of the government, I'm not talking about the country. I'm talking about the specific way governments, people who runs the country are deciding their decisions upon their daily decisions. All these money issues are impacting jobs. My friends, who's an interior architect and now they're working at cafes, then I have one of them ask me for a job from my dad. The job owners are paying little money for students because, like for an hour, some I know some guys, they earn nine or ten Turkish lira. It's actually nothing at the time of making this video that's equal to less than $10 a day. Let's say I wanted to have my own place by now, but there's no way that I can afford it now. Most students can't go out. Mostly, young people stay at home and doing some jobs or works, but they can't go out. I mean, all of my friends and I are just like looking for jobs that pay in dollars because that's the only way to just survive here. Owning a car here has become near-impossible as Turkey's government imposes high taxes on importing cars. In fact, these taxes make Turkey one of the most expensive places to own a car can't buy. The new cars are starting from 300,000 Turkish lira. It's so much money and it's impossible to buy a car. Things are similar for Apple product, where Turkey has imposed a nearly 30% tax on Apple products. Apple is crazy and shaky because, like I got this phone from New York about like 8000 lira. But if I happen to get this phone in Turkey, it will cost me about like 16,000 lira. So what's next for Turkey? I want to go abroad, but my money is getting lower, my savings are getting lower and lower. And actually, I don't know what can I do? I might think to go To the U.S. again, because everything's so expensive and when you just even we earn dollars and euros, it doesn't mean anything like you spend so much money for everything. Our school is right there and it's called the German school, so we are going to Germany, hopefully getting out of our country to study in Germany. I think I'm going to put my life in Germany. I want that the government will be changed, but I'm not sure about that still, and they don't know how to pull Gen-Z into their side. So I think they will be going off in 2023. A lot of times as we talk, you're laughing. You know, this is I mean, this is it seems like it would be stressful. It's money like, what can I leave everyday in Turkey. You can't always the excuse that you can't always be moody. You have to be happy because you can't sleep. Are you worried the currency will get even worse? No, I don't think so, and that is the worst times, but we will get used to it. It never gets better. People just get use like we just live like that."
Labour Law Advisor,1.0,ldAHIk1ulfs,"You must have heard this many times that injection increases the tax a lot, but let me explain how it works, it is very simple, induction means a technique due to which you can check the price of any thing with inflation, sometimes how does our government do it every year by clicking on a number, it is cost inflation indexed, in this oil it is clearly written that the thing which was worth ₹100 in 2000, should be worth 317 rupees in 2021, now how it happens in texture is very simple friends, let me tell you that in 2005 we bought a house for 5 lakh rupees, today that house can be sold for around 80 lakh rupees, so if we sell it for one crore, then our actual profit will be ₹5, but this is not taxable profit, this ₹5 will be taken as base price, we will multiply it by ₹14 lakh, 2000, that is, let us assume that It will be understood that if we buy it for fourteen lakhs instead of 5 lakhs, then where there is an Excel profit of 95% on the sale of one crore, the same table 2018 fixed life of this and if we had to pay 20%, then we would have easily saved tax of 3 lakhs in this."
Afford Anything Podcast,1.0,fyWrbUcCPr0,[Music] you can afford anything you just can't afford everything every choice that you make is a trade-off against something else and that doesn't just apply to your money that applies to your time your focus your energy your attention to any limited resource that you need to manage saying yes to something implicitly means turning away all other opportunities and that opens up two critical questions first what matters most not what does society say ought to matter most but what is truly a priority a value in your life that's the first question and the second question is how do you put that into action how do you make decisions that reflect that which matters most answering these two questions is a lifetime practice and that's what this podcast is here to explore and facilitate my name is paula pant i'm the host of the afford anything podcast and in today's episode we're going to take a deep dive into understanding inflation it's a hot topic it's been on everyone's mind it's the subject of news reports headlines cocktail party conversation what is inflation today's episode will be an explainer episode to peel back the layers of the onion and understand what this concept truly is now we're gonna do that for the first two thirds of the show and then the final one third of the show we're going to close out with something completely different in the final one third of the show i will be playing a speech that i made at the economy conference which is a conference that draws a lot of people who are chasing financial independence so that's what's in store for the final third of the show but for the first two thirds of the show let's understand inflation first a few disclaimers before we get started number one we are not trying to predict the future we are simply trying to make sense of the present so this discussion about inflation is educational not predictive and nothing i say is meant to be taken as a device only as background for educational and entertainment purposes number two i am not an econ professor nor do i play one on tv i trained as a journalist many years ago and today i'm a finance podcaster which is a polite way of saying i'm a person with access to the internet so take that for what it's worth now with those two disclaimers out of the way let's get started and we're going to break this discussion into five parts part one what is inflation what's the cause of inflation part two what are the effects of inflation and how are different types of assets impacted part three how is inflation measured part four historic examples and part five the relationship between inflation and unemployment all right let's get started part one what is inflation and what causes it there are some who define inflation as too much money chasing too few goods that's a cute description certainly a sticky one but it is a description that overly emphasizes the demand side of the causes of inflation so rather than describe it as too much money chasing too few goods the more technical description is that inflation is what takes place when the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy and this results in a decline in purchasing power for a given currency in other words goods and services cost more than they used to so if the cause of inflation is that the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy that presents an obvious follow-up question which is how does the money supply grow there are three common ways that it can happen number one the money supply can grow from the printing and issuance of new money number two the money supply can grow when a government decides to loan a new money into the banking system by purchasing government bonds and number three the money supply can grow if a government decides to legally devalue the currency now in addition to those three ways that the money supply can grow printing money loaning money and legally devaluing the currency the other element of inflation is not just the supply of money but the velocity of money so the supply of money is what we just discussed new money gets pumped into the system through one or a combination of the three mechanisms that we just described but the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands the speed of transaction if a bunch of money is pumped into the system but everyone hides it under their mattress this doesn't create the same type of inflationary pressure as new money getting pumped into the system and then buyers and sellers exchanging that money for goods and services at high velocity the supply of money is the attribute that a government can directly control the velocity of money however can only indirectly be influenced through the mechanisms that create or detract from consumer confidence and investor confidence so how does that confidence the willingness of consumers to spend how does that contribute to inflation in order to answer that question we first must take a step back and ask ourselves how exactly is it that both the money supply and the velocity of money have an impact in inflation what is the mechanism through which that takes place the answer to that question is that there are three common mechanisms one takes place when demand outpaces supply the growth in money supply leads to consumer confidence in other words people have more money so they want to spend it but production capabilities can't match that demand when that happens when demand outpaces supply we wind up in a situation where we have too much money chasing too few goods resulting in higher prices however that is only one of three mechanisms the second mechanism takes place when manufacturers suppliers retailers when they face higher production costs this happens when there's some disruption that makes the cost of raw materials or the cost of production rise and that has a downstream effect on the retail costs of goods and services so for example the cost of copper the cost of lumber the cost of steel if there is some disruption either to the acquisition of raw materials or to the processing the transportation the production capabilities or supply chain capabilities if there are any upstream disruptions then the producers in the middle face longer wait times and higher costs and this gets passed down to the end consumer that's the second mechanism and then the third mechanism is what's known as the wage price spiral this takes place when prices begin to rise which means life gets more expensive as a result workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising prices businesses raise wages and raise salaries in order to meet that worker demand and in order to attract and retain talent and businesses then have to raise the price of their own goods and services in order to pay their higher labor costs this creates a self-reinforcing spiral known as the wage price spiral so that's the third mechanism now if much of what i've talked about sounds familiar it's because this is the story that we have all lived over the last two years on the demand side when we went into shutdowns in 2020 services like concerts massages haircuts those services were no longer available and so consumers turned their demand away from services and towards goods in addition stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits grew the money supply and kept consumer confidence strong further fueling this demand for goods but the production capabilities and the supply chain capabilities for producers to produce those goods could not meet this added demand in addition to that in many sectors in order for producers to be able to increase their production capacity they either need to make very large capital expenditure investments that require a long lead time as is the case with lumber lumber milling or producers didn't have the confidence that this demand would persist after the shutdowns ended and so for certain items producers felt it too risky to invest in enhanced capex if that means that they might end up in a situation two years in the future where they are over producing once this temporary boost in demand subsides now on top of all of that we've talked about the wage price spiral but fueling that wage price spiral was a labor shortage as more people opted out of the workforce either because they need to homeschool their children they need to care for an ill or elderly family member or they received enough in various forms of non-wage payment that they could afford to opt out of the workforce and so the labor shortage amplified the wage price spiral and so you can see what's happened in the last two years is that when we talk about these three mechanisms that fuel inflation one being demand outpaces supply two being higher production costs and three being the wage price spiral there have been other inflationary periods where one or two of those factors have driven inflation but in the last two years we have experienced pronounced effects in all three and so this wraps up part one of the five key parts of this episode part one being where we address the question what is inflation and what causes it and to recap the highlights inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services and a decrease in the purchasing power of a given currency and it happens when the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy the money supply grows through the printing and issuance of new money through the loaning of new money into the system and through legally devaluing the currency the money supply however is just one of two factors that influence inflation the other being the velocity of money so the supply of money and the velocity of money both play a role and they play a role through three mechanisms demand outpaces supply higher production costs and the wage price spiral so that's the recap of part one all right let's move to part two what are the effects of inflation part one we discussed cause part two we're discussing effect and let's start with the good news some degree of inflation is desirable inflation spurs investment because investors look to various assets like equities commodities real estate in order to beat inflation inflation also spurs spending because the knowledge that cash tomorrow will be worth less than cash today is a motivator to spend now so it's healthy for a society to have a small controlled degree of inflation times in developed economies like the united states a target inflation rate of around two percent is considered just the right dose in more rapidly developing economies that inflation rate can notch up a bit higher india has set its target inflation rate at four percent with a plus minus two percent on either end so they've set a target range of between two to six percent so different nations set different inflation targets because inflation does produce some healthy benefits into the system but even in the best of times inflation needs to be managed carefully and every time a government introduces new money into a financial system the first order effect is felt based on how where and when that new money is issued and this leads to a discussion around something called the cantelon effect quick pronunciation note some people call it the cantillon effect others pronounce it the cantelon effect i'll be calling it cantelon it was named for an economist who lived in the 18th century named richard cantelon he observed that when new money enters into a system when the money supply grows it does not have an immediate universal effect on all prices in all industries impacting all people instead it has a localized effect and the closer you are to that injection of liquidity the faster you will feel that effect so the cantalon effect states that prices and inflation will rise at different rates for different market sectors which is a concept known as relative inflation now what this means is that those who are closest to the source of that money the source of the new liquidity that's entering the system will enjoy a higher quality of life and will have the opportunity to generate the largest amount of wealth as a result of their proximity to this liquidity that's entering the system stated simply when new money enters a system the people or companies who can get their hands on it first can take advantage of this new money and make investments and allow this money to compound and grow and they can do that before this injection of new money into the financial system has time to spread across the entire system in other words they can make investments before inflation becomes obvious everywhere and that's why decisions around how where and when new money enters the system is so critically important think back to the beginning of the pandemic when individuals and households were receiving stimulus checks remember that first stimulus check it was a huge input of new money into the system and when those stimulus checks came out a lot of individual investors opened up accounts on robinhood and started investing their stimis the cultural phenomenon of meme stocks and stonks the reddit run-up of gamestop and amc theaters all of that happened when new money entered into the financial system but inflation hadn't kicked in yet and so those who received that new money were able to invest it or use it to speculate now oftentimes banks or financial institutions are the recipients of the new money supply because as we discussed earlier one way that the money supply grows is by loaning new money into the banking system by purchasing bonds once the banking system has money they're able to lend it out both to businesses such as small businesses looking for loans and to consumers such as retail home buyers and the people in companies who were able to get those loans are poised to benefit significantly as inflation picks up because inflation is good for borrowers particularly good for borrowers with fixed rate loans because when you borrow money and you have a fixed interest rate and that rate is less than the rate of inflation then over time you repay that loan with cheaper and cheaper dollars so inflation is great for borrowers this is a wonderful time to have a fixed rate mortgage or a few of them if you're a rental property investor but it's bad for savers because savings are eroded inflation is good for exporters because exporters can produce something while paying the production costs associated with a weaker us dollar they can then sell that item overseas and collect payment in a stronger currency and they can benefit from that enhanced spread so inflation is good for exporters but it's bad for importers because a weaker us dollar means that foreign-made goods are more expensive another way in the u.s every dollar becomes less valuable and so what does that mean for assets how are different types of assets impacted well tangible assets that are valued in currency like real estate gold commodities these are inflation hedges and particularly if you have a tangible asset like real estate and a fixed rate loan as a borrower who has borrowed money in order to acquire that tangible asset you now have a fantastic setup in an inflationary environment not only do you own a tangible asset you also are a borrower in a period of high inflation so it's a double win now in contrast to tangible assets paper assets assets that are denominated in currency like cash or bonds these types of assets are eroded by inflation so in an inflationary environment tangible assets good paper assets bad borrowing money good saving money i don't want to say bad saving money is a value that i espouse but yeah inflation is bad for savers broadly speaking stocks and real estate have historically been great hedges against inflation but not all stocks are created equal growth stocks in particular are negatively affected now what do i mean when i say growth stocks let's pause let's take a step back we'll zoom out stocks equities generally are classified based on size style and location so when i say size i'm talking large cap mid cap small cap when i say location i'm talking u.s international emerging markets frontier markets and when i say style i'm talking about growth stocks value stocks or a blend those are three common classifications for equities now let's take a close-up look at the style classification growth stocks are stocks that seem to be very promising for the future so they may not necessarily be turning a profit right now their numbers today might not look that great but their future prospects seem optimistic enough that investors are willing to make a bet that these stocks these growth stocks will outperform the market over time this is in contrast to the alternate style value stocks which are stocks that typically tend to be performing well today but the investors decide are trading at a cost that is less than what they're actually worth in other words with value stocks investors believe that the market has undervalued the worth of a given company the market has underpriced that company and so value stocks are sought after based on their current performance and their current price relative to their current performance by contrast growth stocks are sought after based on the expectation of their future performance and this is where inflation starts to fiddle with those numbers because when dollars become less valuable the present value of those future dollars is also reduced and as a result growth stocks tend to take a hit in an inflationary environment now tech stocks tend to represent a lot of growth stocks and the tech sector also represents the biggest stocks talk large cap the biggest stocks in the index so among the 10 biggest stocks in the s p 500 we find apple microsoft amazon facebook google tesla and nvidia all of which are tech stocks all of which are among the 10 biggest stocks in the overall s p 500 now just because they're tech stocks doesn't mean they're necessarily considered growth stocks that's disclaimer number one that i want to make disclaimer number two that i want to make is that sometimes a growth investor and a value investor might both buy the same stock for different reasons philip fisher is one of the most acclaimed american investors of the 20th century he is sometimes referred to as the father of growth investing and ironically his son is a value investor and he wrote about times when both he and his son would purchase exactly the same stock but philip fisher would come to that decision through a decision-making framework that prioritized growth stocks and his son would come to that same decision through a decision-making framework that prioritized value investing so that's the second disclaimer that i want to throw out there not all tech stocks are growth stocks and some growth stocks are also really good value stock picks with that said it is also the case that there's a lot of overlap between growth stocks and tech stocks and it is also the case that the broad market is heavily represented by large cap tech stocks and so some of the volatility the swings that we're seeing in the market right now and the declines that some major companies have faced in the past few weeks much of that reflects investors repricing these stocks and reassessing what they're willing to pay for the prospect of future returns in light of the high inflationary environment that we're currently in so stocks and real estate historically are great hedges against inflation but not all stocks are created equal and there will be in the short term volatility in the markets as investors reassess what they believe companies are worth in light of inflation expectations and by the way i don't mean to constantly be banging the pro real estate drum but if you've spent the last couple of years sitting on the sidelines considering possibly investing in real estate the draw of locking in a fixed rate mortgage and buying a tangible asset that historically is a low volatility inflation hedge that tangible asset of course being real estate that draw the inflation protection that real estate can provide is particularly appealing at this point in time we know that inflation is not transitory it's here to stay and the current economic environment really highlights the usefulness of holding a tangible asset like real estate that provides a stable long-term inflation hedge if you want to learn more about real estate go to affordance dot com slash vip list that's afford anything dot com slash vip list we'll email you a ton of information about real estate it's totally free lots of valuable information contained there around how to approach this asset class afford anything dot com slash vip list so let's recap what we've talked about in part one we defined what is inflation we discussed the causes of inflation and we related this to everything that's transpired in the last two years in part two we discussed the effects of inflation we talked about how some degree of inflation is desirable a target of around two percent for a developed nation like the us and that even in the best of times inflation needs to be managed carefully because anytime you inject liquidity into a financial system the effect is not felt equally we discussed the cantillin effect which describes the concept of relative inflation which means there's a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy that takes place at different times and the closer a person or entity is to the source of that liquidity the faster they're likely to be to access that money and therefore generate wealth so the cantillon effect describes how the new money supply has localized effects we talked about how inflation is bad for some people and good for others for example it's bad for savers and good for borrowers bad for importers good for exporters we talked about the difference between tangible assets versus paper assets and we described growth versus value stocks part three of this five part deep dive understanding inflation at a conceptual level remember as we discussed in part two inflation doesn't happen universally across all sectors of the economy at the same time and so in order to measure inflation we have to track a diversified basket of goods and services there are two such baskets that are used in the u.s one is the cpi the other is the ppi the cpi the consumer price index is a weighted basket of consumer needs so it represents things like transportation food medical care the types of necessities and consumer staples that individuals and households have to buy which is another way of saying the cpi measures or at least attempts to measure cost of living so when the cpi is calculated retail prices are tracked meaning they're not looking at production costs they're not looking at wholesale costs they're looking purely at what you or i would pay for an item on the open market and then those changes in price are weighted in proportion to the significance of that good or service when it comes to household spending so all these retail prices are being tracked in accordance with their relative weight within this basket but here's the thing sometimes there are items in this basket that change in price for reasons that don't have anything to do with inflation and sometimes those items constitute such a big chunk of household spending that including those items in there can really throw the numbers off specifically i'm talking about food and fuel sometimes food prices go up because there was a hurricane or there's some sort of e coli outbreak or as happened recently a safety inspector got a credible death threat and now we have a shortage of avocados coming in from mexico which is causing the price of guacamole to go up these types of events particularly natural disasters weather events these can temporarily impact the price of food or the price of certain types of food but it doesn't reflect anything related to inflation and similarly the cost of fuel oil and gas that can be impacted by a whole bunch of factors including political factors that don't necessarily reflect inflation so both of those sectors food and fuel are pretty volatile if those two sectors move that can have an outsized impact on cpi even though it doesn't actually reflect inflationary pressures and so there's a measure a different measure referred to as core inflation and core inflation is the measure of cpi minus food and fuel core inflation looks at price changes across that same diversified basket of services goods and services except for food and energy in order to mitigate the impact of these volatile sectors is it a better way to measure inflation that's a subject of debate but certainly it provides another data point that can round out the picture and another data point that can round out the picture is what's known as the ppi the producer price index and this measures the average weighted price changes that sellers receive for intermediate goods to state it simply the cpi is looking at inflation from the perspective of retail buyers you and me the ppi is looking at inflation from the perspective of sellers and producers if you go to the bureau of labor statistics website you'll see that the ppi publishes more than 3 700 commodity price indexes for goods and 800 for seasonally adjusted services so they're tracking a lot of the price changes that are happening upstream and that offers another layer of insight that can round out the way that we monitor and measure inflation now we don't hear about ppi as much on the news typically we'll hear some headline related to the cpi and often the discussion is really around two things number one how much has it gone up but number two how fast is it continuing to go up have we hit an apex after which the rate of increase will slow or are we a boulder rolling down a hill with lots of momentum and no sign of stopping anytime you're monitoring any metric or any change you're looking not just at the month over month numbers but also at the increase or decrease within those numbers over time and again this episode is not here to predict the future this episode is here to have a stronger understanding of the present and so to that end bear in mind that whenever you see a headline about cpi look not just at the most recent reported change but also at how that change compares contextually to the rate at which it's been changing and that wraps up part three our discussion on how inflation is measured leading us to part four let's talk about some historic examples how has inflation played out in the past we'll start in the 1920s with the german weimar republic germany financed world war one by borrowing heavily and printing huge amounts of unbacked currency fiat currency and the reason i'm taking the time to note that it was unbacked was because prior to world war one germany's currency was backed by gold germany got rid of this gold standard in 1914 and at the time the german mark the french franc the italian lira and the british shilling all had roughly equal value and roughly comparable dollar exchange rates us dollar exchange rates so that was the situation in 1914 but then from 1914 to 1919 prices of everything in germany doubled as germany both borrowed a lot of money and printed a lot of money to be able to pay for the war world war one ended in 1918 and under the treaty of versailles it was required to make reparations payments in gold-backed marks this created a degree of financial stress and remember how we mentioned that prices doubled between 1914 and 1919 well they doubled again between 1919 and 1922. and so by 1922 many citizens were starting to get rid of their paper assets get rid of their currency and convert it into tangible assets pianos diamonds pieces of art real estate people began piling into tangible goods because prices had doubled twice in the last eight years but despite this people were more worried about unemployment than they were about inflation the chief objective was to keep the population working and germany saw that given the devaluation of the mark they were well poised to be able to export many of their goods so they just kept printing money they kept printing money in order to facilitate exports and keep the population employed and what happened next was it spiraled out of control in 1914 one u.s dollar was worth about four or five german marks by november 1923 one us dollar was equal to one trillion marks so at that point the currency straight up lost all meaning and ordinary citizens were bartering goods with one another they were that into tangible assets that by 1923 people were trading a handkerchief for some carrots or a shirt for some shoes people were also especially pre-1923 when it really went to rail back in 1921 before it spiraled out of control people were also aggressively investing in foreign currencies trading german marks for a litany of currencies from many other nations as a side note i will make the connection that cryptocurrencies which are non-fiat currencies grew in popularity during the pandemic and as i've said many times before on this podcast when we talk about quote unquote investing in crypto what we're really talking about is a form of currency exchange in which you exchange one medium of exchange the us dollar for a different medium of exchange such as bitcoin or ethereum or stellar lumens now i'm not stating that the us is going to be the weimar republic absolutely not but i do think there's a notable parallel that when a population anticipates inflation one of the things that ordinary individuals do is they start converting their money into other forms of currency and it happens that we currently live in an age where currency can be digital and programming language can be written such that the issuance of new supply of that digital currency into circulation is governed by an algorithm rather than by politicians again i am not comparing the us to the weimar republic in any way whatsoever please don't think i'm doing that and and what i'm largely speaking to is the reframing of cryptocurrency not as an investment but as an alternate currency at any rate this is a history lesson so we won't go down the crypto rabbit hole but that is the cautionary tale of the weimar republic and it's a tale of hyperinflation and while it's easy to say well that was the 1920s that happened in literally a century ago and that was a very different time there was a war in europe there was a different pandemic the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and that was a much deadlier pandemic one third of the world's population ended up infected by the virus and about 50 million people worldwide died in that pandemic so they were dealing with a lot back then nothing that we could ever relate to so why spend all this time talking about something that happened a century ago why live in the past and if that's what you're thinking all right fair enough let's talk about zimbabwe zimbabwe was the first nation to experience hyperinflation in the 21st century in 2007 as the rest of the world was undergoing the great recession zimbabwe's inflation rate topped 50 per month and it got worse from there by november 2008 prices were doubling on average every 24 hours but i don't want to sound alarmist or i don't want to sound as though i'm telling you about these historic examples in order to create an alarmist narrative because the reality is nothing like that has ever happened in the united states in 2007 2008 when zimbabwe was experiencing hyperinflation we in the u.s were experiencing what's known as biflation biflation is an example of the cantillon effect and it happens when there's strong demand for certain types of assets and weak demand for others causing prices in one sector of the economy to rise and prices in other sectors to fall which means that we simultaneously experience both inflation and deflation at the same time that's biflation that's what happened in the u.s during the great recession of 2007-2008 given the severity of the 2008 recession and given the amount of money that was pumped into the economy in order to get us out of that recession it is truly uplifting and very fortuitous that inflation fears that some of us held during that time did not come to pass we ended that recession and launched into a decade of prosperity with a low inflation rate an 11-year bull run and an unprecedented flourishing of digital innovation that took place over the last decade and so fortunately our most recent example of inflation or specifically biflation fortunately is not a cautionary tale it did not spiral out of control in fact the worst that the u.s has experienced was a two-decade period from the mid-1960s
