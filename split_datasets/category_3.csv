IMF,3.0,F0VaaZdH1x0,"Hi, I'm Sandile from the IMF. And throughout this series, I'm going to be answering your questions about thorny economic issues, breaking them down, and giving you straight answers, without all that fancy academic speak. Let's get started. There's been a lot of talk about inflation around the world, but what is it really, and why is it happening? So, what is inflation? Inflation is a broad-based increase in the price of things. First, when I say broad-based, I really mean that, inflation is not about the price of broccoli going up versus spinach, because there's been some new diet fad that says that broccoli is better for you. It's about the prices of vegetables rising in general, and about the prices of other things rising. Now, for consumers like you and me, it's about a broad-based increase in the prices of things that we consume and pay for. So that includes things like groceries, gas, subway passes. For businesses, it's about a broad-based increase in the prices of things that they pay for. So that includes the computers that we work with, or the electricity bill for the lights in this cafeteria. There's a second related point, which is that it's about the representative basket of things that consumers actually consume, on average, across the entire population. So, maybe subway pass prices are going up, but that's not going to factor into country-wide inflation in a major way, unless most people in the country actually ride the subway. Now, the reason that we care about inflation is that it can lower people's living standards. When prices rise faster than wages, people are effectively getting poorer. A dollar that I have today is worth less than the dollar that I had last year. That makes me worse off. That's why we say that inflation is the worst tax on the poor. worst tax on the poor. So, why is it happening? So, why is it happening? Well, there's two big buckets of reasons. The first is when there's shortages in supply, or slowdowns in supply. So let's think about coffee production, since we're here in this cafe. Let's say that there's a bad harvest or a drought, which reduces the amount of coffee beans. However, everyone in the world, including myself, is still going to have the same demand for those coffee beans, and that's going to nudge prices up. Or, take COVID as an example. A lot of people were asked to stay home to avoid spreading the virus. In some cases, that led to a shutdown in ports or shipping terminals, limiting supplies. Again, that nudged up prices. The other big bucket is on the demand side. So people demanding or wanting more goods and services than there are available. Sometimes economists call this an economy ""overheating"" or ""running hot."" ""overheating"" or ""running hot."" ""overheating"" or ""running hot."" So what can governments do to ease it? Well, first, it depends on the source of inflation. But the broad idea is that governments want to bring down price increases to a manageable and stable level, both for businesses and consumers. Let's start with the demand side. So governments, through their central banks, can decrease demand by increasing interest rates. So, whether you're buying a house and taking out a loan to do so, or if you're charging things to your credit card, higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs. And so those costs are going to go up, and that means less money to spend on other things. However, it also incentivizes saving. So, a lot of savings accounts give you small interest payments when you put your money in the bank. Those interest payments are also going to go up. Now, on the other side, governments can also cut spending or increase taxes. And the broad idea is that there's less money sloshing around to spend things on. Now, let's think about the supply side. It's a little bit trickier, but governments can still do something. In some cases, governments might have special reserves to lessen the damage. Think strategic oil reserves. But not all countries have these or they're not large enough to have an impact. The second thing governments can do in the longer-term is create an environment that incentivizes businesses to produce more. So let's think about a competitive environment. So you want to avoid situations where you have just one or a few firms setting prices in one industry. So, for example, let's say that we live in a small town and there's just one pizza place. That one pizza place could charge us whatever they wanted to to get those pizzas. Now, consider competing pizza places coming in. That firm is probably going to reduce its prices in order to keep its customers. Now, stepping back in reality, sometimes we both have too much demand and too little supply. So it's a balancing act. And governments often use a mix of policies to help tame inflation. So with that said, I'm going to buy some lunch to tame my appetite. Please be sure to send all of your questions to AskAnEconomist@imf.org. I'll see you next time."
Eurostat,3.0,5a9gWG8g_GY,"You may often hear grown-ups talking about inflation, but what does that mean? Let's investigate! Every week you get your pocket money. You know, this is enough for 3 scoops of ice cream! But suddenly, one day, you can only buy one scoop of ice cream. What happened? So, the price of the ice cream went up. But why? Inflation! Prices of products in shops can go up because their cost of production increases. Ice cream is made of milk, sugar, chocolate... ...and we also need flour from wheat for the cone. And sometimes a bad year can mean less wheat. And less wheat means higher prices. Because everybody needs wheat - for bread, cookies and ice cream cones! So ice cream becomes more expensive! But, ask your parents, because the same can happen to other things too!"
Economics Explained,3.0,Y2i7Ng6cEKY,several government bonds from around the world are now offering negative yields as in if you buy the bond you are going to get back less money than you put into it so who in their right mind would buy an investment where you are guaranteed to lose money the answer is mostly large institutions that need somewhere safe to keep their cash you see regular bank accounts just don't cut it when you have tens of billions of dollars because they are normally only insured up to a certain level in the us for example that level is 250 000 government bonds are for obvious reasons fully backed by the government so if for example apple was afraid of inflation of the us dollar and wanted to keep its vast piles of cash as euros let's say it would have to pick a safe country like germany that uses the euro and take whatever they were offering for their bonds this might still work out to be a profitable decision though if the euro loses value to inflation at just 0.4 percent per year slower than the us dollar
Economics Explained,3.0,GTECeK3lxr4,an alarming trend is emerging that suggests the U.S and global economy may be headed towards stagflation stagflation is a situation in which the inflation rate is high or increasing the economic growth rate is slowing and unemployment remains steadily High it presents a dilemma for policy makers since actions intended to lower inflation May exacerbate unemployment recent data from the World Bank indicates the US's real GDP growth in 2022 was 1.3 percent lower than the fed's two percent projection what the FED in the World Bank seem to agree on however is the forecast for real GDP growth for 2023 is a disappointing 0.2 percent couple that news with forecasts of four percent inflation rates in 2023 significantly higher than the federal reserve's two percent Target now you have a recipe for worry in a survey conducted by Bank of America 83 percent of economists expect little economic growth alongside higher than expected inflation to come so despite being similar to pre-pandemic levels the current unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is still not enough for economists to put aside Their Fear of stagflation
Capital.com,3.0,g5drje2nxkM,the late 1970s an era defined by bell bottoms some big characters dubious fashion disco and high inflation we cannot accept high rates of inflation as a permanent fact of american life flares may now be a relic of the 20th century but some economists fear a return to high inflation the likes of which have not been seen for more than 40 years inflation is on the rise inflation inflation is a real concern and since the start of 2021 it has been rising steadily across the world inflation could be a lot less temporary than some of the central banks seem to think it is we're experiencing a number of novel developments that we have rarely observed in the past the cause now to growing concerns about the deadly coronavirus the pandemic has created a set of highly unusual economic conditions high inflation is detrimental to a healthy economy if it lasts longer it will affect the stock market it will affect consumers it will affect the economy a lot if inflation continues to rise what effect will it have on the stock market and your wealth when covert 19 started global lockdown markets plummeted you must stay at home do not travel abroad you could describe it as panic with investors dumping all sorts of risk assets including stocks goodness look at those numbers there an economic shock of unknowable scale is upon us fears of covey 19 grid the nation we were seeing fairly vicious falls almost every day the pandemic disrupted global supply chains production lines came to a standstill shipping stalled and air freight were grounded i think plenty of people thought that this could well be the start of a bear market but within five weeks something extraordinary happened the s p 500 which tracks the 500 largest companies in america had plummeted in march 2020 but it soon rallied and its value doubled over the next 18 months it felt like it almost shrugged off the effects of the corona virus or factored it in very quickly and it was back to business as usual lockdowns meant that people were spending less than before the pandemic at the same time governments were taking unprecedented steps to recharge their economies the single biggest economic relief the largest emergency of stimulus for the agencies time in our history the government is going to help to pay people's wages in the us alone the government has allocated more than four trillion dollars on stimulus funding congress adopted an approach that was aimed at supporting incomes of u.s families across the u.s and the idea was that in the presence of massive job losses the key intent was to support income all of this fiscal stimulus really supercharged consumer spending we saw central banks lower interest rates so the cost of borrowing is low and qe quantitative easing you know effectively pumping money into the economy a lot of which finds its way into markets to try and prop up and avoid any sort of massive crash john q has a private little nest egg his practical nature tells him it ought to do more than collect moths in a world of low interest rates consumers look elsewhere for better returns in their investments what are you going to do with your cash you don't want to leave it in the bank if you sold off in the worry of a bear market you're getting not very much return leaving it in a savings account so it's going to find its way into the stock market but the pandemic limited the supply of goods and since economies have reopened supply has been playing catch-up with that new-found surge in demand that has led to a rapid increase in inflation we saw the categories like motor vehicles like cars see a rapid acceleration in prices and in inflation it means your dollar or pound or yen won't buy as much tomorrow as it did today these lines chart the price of the two most popular oil stocks west texas intermediate and brent crude after falling to historic lows in april 2020 the prices of both types of oil have recovered sharply we have not seen supply of oil come back to its precovet level we've seen restraint on the front of opec and we've seen restraint on the u.s front in terms of oil production crude oil prices and natural gas prices have really surged the heads of a number of central banks have used cautious language this year saying that inflation is a transient thing or that we think it's going to be temporary their right to calm fears psychology plays a role in all of this too i don't know why i'm telling you this i'm a dentist you're the psychoanalyst if consumers fear long-term higher rates of inflation it can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy was that fair doctor tell me honestly what you think as they quickly spend to avoid higher prices in the future in that environment we are in what is called the price spiral and essentially this risks having runaway inflation we're not in that inflationary psychology right now traditionally central banks have controlled inflation by raising interest rates which makes borrowing more expensive their real fear is hyperinflation examples of which are strewn through history in these cases currencies became worthless no one is suggesting that any major economies are heading for hyperinflation but any period of higher inflation does have a knock-on effect on the stock market historically inflation can spell bad news for company stocks take a look at the dow jones index it measures 30 of the best performing companies in the us the red line charts its performance over the last 14 years between 2007 and 2011 when the us rate of inflation thus the blue line moved above three percent the index reacted negatively first in 2008 when inflation spiked during the subprime mortgage crisis the dow lost almost half its value and again in 2011 when an inflation increase was soon followed by a weaker index value when it comes to periods of higher inflation markets and investing can get a lot trickier some stocks traditionally outperform in times of higher inflation duke university in north carolina recently published a paper looking at historical returns over the past 95 years of different u.s equity sectors when inflation moved above 5 researchers focused on eight sustained periods of inflation from 1926 to 2020 when normal demand and supply patterns were jolted by global conflict we are determined to preserve our freedom no matter what the cost oil embargoes oil reserves are running out revolution and economic booms the legislative process to put america back on the road economic health is now fully underway of course historical trends are never a guarantee of future performance but the researchers found that across all sectors energy stocks delivered the best positive annual returns companies that produce gas that produce oil that produce renewable energy they will all be thriving during inflationary times but it is because inflation is caused by increase in energy prices soft commodities such as corn wheat fruit or livestock have also historically held or increased their stock prices and this is holding true today since january 2021 the three best performing soft commodities have soared in price the researchers at juke university found that commodities offered on average a 14 return on investments during periods of high inflation historically the fate of bank stocks during periods of high inflation has been hard to gauge how much are you going to start off with five shillings good when inflation hits there is an expectation of an interest rate hike from central banks so in theory banks should benefit from that because an interest rate hike makes it more profitable for banks to lend money well i think we can make you this long will the bank need security no i don't think so inflationary pressure however can also signal that an economy is in difficulty ideal conditions for debt defaults to arise this seems okay banks are very very embedded in that economic cycle dynamics so they actually might get hit by the sort of recession that may follow an inflation spike then there are the less flashy age-old stocks which typically offer steady but not spectacular growth rates these are known as value stocks as investors become a bit more concerned about the economy and the effect that higher inflation could have on it they could turn away from perhaps some of the more aggressive go-getter tech type stocks for example and look to a more traditional blue chip dividend yield slightly safer play we took a look at the top three growth stocks and the top three value stocks based on index weight according to the s p growth and value index we studied the relationship between stock price and inflation since 2007 when the rate of inflation moved above two percent the price of these growth stocks tends to decrease more quickly than the price of the value stocks as the rate of inflation increases technology stocks could suffer if we had higher inflation some of them anyway clearly some of the big names if we take the likes of facebook amazon netflix google they weren't around in the 1970s when we had runaway inflation so it's difficult to know how they will be impacted instead of focusing on potential growth in times of inflation investors tend to look at how much leverage or debt a specific company or stock has taken on value stocks are typically better placed in this respect it's unlikely that rich economies are headed back to the kind of double-digit inflation last seen in the late 70s i want to have a frank talk with you tonight about our most serious domestic problem inflation we are going to see some cooling of inflation but inflation is likely to remain persistently higher than it was in the decade before the coveted crisis if we do see interest rates gradually get ratcheted up that could be perhaps something of a bigger shock than stock markets were expecting and could be a reason for people to perhaps head for the exits gradually on stock markets a more likely scenario is a period of what's known as stagflation where inflation rises at the same time as the economy slows either way there will be opportunities for traders and investors 78.77% of retail

TED-Ed,3.0,GFTKKyYSCKs,"In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic rocked economies worldwide. Millions of people lost their jobs, and many businesses struggled to survive or shut down completely. Governments responded with some of the largest economic relief packages in history— the United States alone spent $2.2 trillion on a first round of relief. So where did all this money come from? Most countries have a central bank that manages the money supply and is independent from the government to prevent political interference. The government can implement many types of economic policy, like decreasing people's taxes and creating jobs through public infrastructure projects, but it actually can’t just increase the money supply. The central bank determines how much money is in circulation at a time. So why can’t central banks authorize the printing of unlimited money to help an economy in crisis? They could, but that’s a short-term solution that doesn’t necessarily boost economic growth in the long-term, and can actually hurt the economy. Why? With more money in circulation, manufacturers of goods like food, clothing, and cars could respond to demand simply by raising prices, rather than manufacturing more of these goods and creating new jobs in the process. This would mean you could no longer buy as much with the same amount of money— a situation known as inflation. A little bit of inflation, about 2% a year, is considered a sign of economic health, but more can quickly derail an economy. In recent decades, central banks have tried an approach called quantitative easing to infuse the economy with cash while maintaining a low risk of severe inflation. In this approach, a central bank increases cash flow by purchasing another entity’s bonds. Anyone can buy bonds from corporations or governments. When you buy a bond, you’re essentially loaning money to the company— or government— with the promise that they’ll pay it back later with interest. This is why buying bonds is sometimes referred to as buying debt. When an individual buys a bond, they're using money that's already in circulation. But when the central bank buys a bond, it essentially creates cash, supplying money that didn’t exist before in exchange for bonds. Both during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again in 2020, the United States’ central bank, the Federal Reserve, bought bonds from the US government called treasury bonds. Historically, many people have purchased these bonds as a safe form of investment, knowing the US government will pay them back with interest. In early 2020, the Federal Reserve pledged to buy unlimited treasury bonds, loaning the U.S. government an unprecedented amount of money— cash that the government used to fund relief efforts like stimulus checks and unemployment benefits. This isn’t equivalent to simply printing money, though it may sound similar. Because of the way bonds are priced, by buying so many, the Federal Reserve effectively lowered the return on them, which incentivizes other investors to lend to riskier entities— like small and midsize companies— in order to get a decent return. Encouraging lending this way should help companies of all sizes borrow money to funnel into projects and hires, boosting the economy over time in addition to helping the government supply people with urgently needed cash in the short term. The Federal Reserve’s pledge to buy unlimited government debt has raised some questions— and eyebrows. In theory, this means the government could issue more bonds, which the central bank would purchase. The government could then use the money from the new bonds to pay off the old bonds, effectively meaning the government never pays back its debt to the central bank. Citing this and other theoretical scenarios, some economists have raised concerns that a central bank buying government debt is a subversion of a system designed to protect the economy. Others have insisted these measures are necessary, and have so far helped stabilize economies. Though quantitative easing has become a lot more common in recent years, it’s still relatively new, and potential consequences are still unfolding."

SUNY Brockport,3.0,TuluNRhhb0E,inflation in the united states hasn't been this high in 40 years we're at seven percent inflation meaning that if you didn't get a raise last year you're now seven percent less able to afford goods and services than you were last year and the blame game has started whose fault is it is it fiscally irresponsible policymakers corporate greed putin's foreign aggression as it turns out none of these are the right places to look so how is inflation controlled and what does it mean for our economies and our wallets i'm cameron harwick a professor of economics at suny brockport let's break it down inflation is how economists keep track of how fast average prices are rising in an economy prices meaning it's plural a common mistake people make when thinking about inflation is just looking at one price and usually that's the price of gas but gas prices are a particularly bad metric for inflation because its day-to-day price is so dependent on industry-specific supply factors so feel free to blame putin for high gas prices but if you're looking to know why all prices are rising across the board you have to look beyond any particular industry that's also why when political figures like elizabeth warren blame inflation on corporate greed or when president biden blames it on excessive and unfair profits that might explain high prices in certain industries but it doesn't explain rising prices even in competitive industries did corporations get seven percent greedier last year are our industry seven percent more monopolized than last year of course not and if a company could get seven percent more profit just by raising prices why wouldn't they have done that last year because they can't even monopolies are limited by market conditions now usually we think of the price of a good as reflecting the supply and demand of that good but it's important to remember that a price reflects the supply and demand of two things not just the good that you're buying but also the money that you use to pay for it and the supply of money is the key to understanding inflation since money is used to pay for everything in an economy the supply of money impacts the price of everything and the supply of money is determined by the monetary policy of the federal reserve the central bank of the united states their job is to make sure that the supply of money matches the demand for money and it's a delicate tightrope if the federal reserve undershoots you get deflation and recession which means that prices will fall and unemployment rises and if it overshoots you get inflation and shortages throughout the supply chain when the covet 19 pandemic first hit the demand for money rose but the federal reserve overshot with the supply of money but you can't blame that on the president or congress as many might think now the government did respond in multiple ways to the pandemic including sending out stimulus checks and some people blame those checks for increasing consumer spending and therefore causing inflation but the checks themselves don't affect the supply of money and they don't necessarily increase total spending after all that money has to come from somewhere and congress doesn't have the ability to print money since the federal reserve is operationally independent of congress congress can't ask the federal reserve to print more money for them either and good thing because they'd likely be running the presses all the time so why did the federal reserve overshoot if it wasn't to pay for the stimulus checks back in 2008 there's a crash in the housing market that spread to the rest of the economy and when the economy gets rocky people get cautious and want to hang on to their money rather than spending it in response the federal reserve created huge amounts of money trying to match that demand but it wasn't enough and for years they undershot and unemployment stayed high the federal reserve doesn't want to repeat that so at the beginning of the pandemic they were much more willing to err on the side of inflation now as the demand for money falls back to normal levels during the recovery the fed is scrambling to undo a lot of that expansion now with inflation at seven percent it's natural to wonder will the u.s lose control of inflation and go the way of venezuela with an inflation rate in the tens of millions that's what we would call hyperinflation and that happens when the government deficit is so bad that the only way they can pay their bills is to force the central bank to print money for them now while the us does have an uncomfortably large national debt there's no sign that congress will have to rely on the federal reserve like that anytime soon in fact the federal reserve has been cautiously contracting for months now they don't want to go too quickly or we could land in a recession that's worse than the inflation it's happened before in 1980 when they tried to get the 14 percent inflation of the 70s under control but if the federal reserve doesn't make any huge missteps we should expect to see inflation fall slowly over the next year or two until we're back at their target rate of about two percent if you're interested in learning more about the economy money markets or macroeconomic trends check out the department of accounting

Economics Explained,3.0,pTuocnl7hSE,world without money would be pretty confusing but that's the world 5th Century Brits lived in when the Romans came to Britain they transformed its economy by introducing money and coins to a population that relied almost entirely on bartering to facilitate trade but when the Roman Empire collapsed so did their strong financial system which caused coinage to disappear all throughout England money basically disappeared driving British Isles straight back into a barter economy the use of coins as an economic medium was abandoned and eventually so are public buildings and town halls for the longest time it seemed there was no evidence money had ever made its way to Britain as everyone returned to bartering methods for another few centuries that's right centuries eventually the use of money made a return when the people of Britain needed to pay protection money to the Vikings to put an end to constant pillaging this economic history lesson serves as a reminder that

Rishi Sunak,3.0,EjpJlPKS7vI,"High inflation is the biggest and most important challenge we face at the moment and despite the really positive news that inflation is falling I know things are still tough for families inflation drives up the cost of living and eats into the pounds in your pocket in short it makes everyone poorer that's why I first warned about this back when I was Chancellor when the impact of the covid pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine drove up prices around the world inflation is the enemy it makes everyone poorer the number one challenge is inflation you guys all see it right all your bills every week every month they're going up and up and up just identifying the problem isn't enough that's why I quickly put in place a plan to deal with it on day one as your prime minister I prioritize the responsible management of our economy taking difficult but fair decisions on things like public sector pay and ensuring government doesn't just pump more money into the economy by borrowing too much we will halve inflation this year to ease the cost of living we've got to keep getting inflation down because even once it's hard that's not enough we've got to get it all the way back down to two percent labor are shouting from the sidelines with no plan all they're talking about is more unfunded borrowing the independent Institute of fiscal study says his policy of never-ending debt and borrowing would increase inflation and drive up interest rates leaving everybody in this country poorer Mr Speaker if we want to halve inflation and then get it all the way down back to two percent we cannot turn back that's why I am working night and day to get on with the job I want to build a better future for you and your family but to do that we have to be at inflation and make sure the money in your pocket goes further that's why we need to stick to my plan I will get it done High inflation is the biggest and most important challenge we face at the moment. And despite the really positive news that inflation is falling. I know things are still tough for families. Inflation drives up the cost of living and eats into the pounds in your pocket. In short, it makes everyone poorer. That's why I first warned about this back when I was Chancellor. When the impact of the COVID pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine drove up prices around the world. Inflation is the enemy. It makes everyone poorer. the number one challenge is inflation. You guys all see it, right? All your bills every week, every month, they're going up and up bills every week, every month, they're going up and up But just identifying the problem isn't enough. That's why I quickly put in place a plan to deal with it. On day one as your Prime Minister, I prioritised the responsible management of our economy, taking difficult but fair decisions on things like public sector pay and ensuring government doesn't just pump more money into the economy by borrowing too much. We will halve inflation this year to ease the cost of living. we've got to keep getting inflation down because even once is halved, that's not enough. We've got to get it all the way back down to 2%, Labour are shouting from the sidelines with no plan. All they're talking about is more unfunded borrowing the Independent Institute of Fiscal Studies says his policy of never ending debt and borrowing would increase inflation and drive up interest rates, leaving everybody in this country poorer. Mr. Speaker. If we want to halve inflation and then get it all the way down back to 2%, we cannot turn back. That's why I am working night and day to get on with the job. I want to build a better future for you and your family. But to do that, we have to beat inflation and make sure the money in your pocket goes further. That's why we need to stick to my plan. I will get it done."

INFLATION: WHAT LIES BEHIND, WHAT IS AHEAD? While economic growth slowed drastically towards the end of 2022, inflation rates have slowed down too, but at unprecedentedly high levels. Headline inflation, which covers all products, including energy and food, peaked in October 2022, before slowly starting to decrease. However… This is still substantially above the 2% inflation target set by the European Central Bank. What causes inflation? Inflation has been mostly driven by extraordinary external factors, such as the COVID pandemic, supply bottlenecks and, most significantly, surging energy prices. HEADLINE INFLATION ENERGY CONTRIBUTION However, energy inflation has slowed down since October 2022. But it would be premature to declare victory against inflation. Inflation drivers increasingly translate into a broader price dynamic. Higher energy costs typically have a gradual and indirect impact on the prices of other goods and services, like non-energy industrial goods. This is why we see that core inflation has been continuously increasing over the last 1.5 years, and it is still increasing. Core inflation includes all goods and services, except for energy and food, which are usually the most volatile price components. How is the European Central Bank reacting? To bring inflation down to the target of 2%, the European Central Bank started the process of policy normalisation, shifting from an aim to raise the inflation path to a monetary policy stance that cements the inflation path at the target. In this process of so-called 'monetary policy tightening', i.e. increasing interest rates, the European Central Bank will now also start to reduce its holdings of assets it bought in the past. It is important to understand what the ECB intends and expects to achieve with this policy. First, monetary policy operates on the demand side, i.e. increasing interest rates lead to tighter financing conditions and, over time, to lower demand for goods and services in the economy. Recent estimates show that the interest rate hikes could lower inflation by 1.2 percentage points in 2023 and 1.8 percentage points in 2024. The negative impact on real GDP growth is estimated to be around 1.5 percentage points on average over three years. Second, monetary policy works with a time lag. Monetary tightening in the eurozone is expected to have its highest impact with a lag of two years. This is important to consider as further interest rate hikes in the coming months are likely. Do wages catch up? So far, workers have borne the brunt of soaring prices. Their incomes have been lower in real terms, given the high inflation rates. To catch up, wage increases are expected to accelerate. With prices increasing more than wages, profit margins have grown, especially in agriculture and energy. New data from the European Central Bank suggests these profit margins contribute to higher prices. What is the outlook? The inflation outlook is heavily influenced by the economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Thus, the ECB is walking a tightrope to calibrate monetary policy. On one hand, it has to ensure that inflation gets back to the 2% target. On the other hand, and given the lags with which monetary policy operates, flexibility is also key to avoid over-tightening and to ensure that the costs to the economy and people are minimal.

The Australia Institute,3.0,zcIjkN9wM0U,the abs have just released inflation figures or more accurately they've released their preferred measure of inflation which is the consumer price index or the cpi and the cpi basically measures all the goods that an average household buys there are tens of thousands of goods and they're weighted depending on how the average household buys them so if the average household spent fifteen percent on groceries then groceries would make up fifteen percent of the cpi if they spent thirty percent on accommodation like rent then rent would make up 30 of the cpi and basically every quarter the abs measures how these prices have increased and mash it together to give us the average increase in prices for the average household now these figures were particularly high this quarter in fact the inflation rate increased at 5.1 which is the fastest rate it's increased since the introduction of the gst so the consumer price index increased by 5.1 over the last year and this is far faster than how fast wages are increasing wages have only increased by 2.3 percent over the last 12 months this means that the amount of stuff that the average household can buy is going down that is the kinds of things they're buying are going up in price faster than their incomes are increasing economists call this the real wage and at the moment real wages are going down now while the average increase in prices is 5.1 percent the abs actually splits all of those goods and services into essential and non-essential goods now essential goods are the kinds of goods that you need to buy things like groceries accommodation electricity and power and they are increasing far faster than non-essential goods so while the average increase in prices is 5.1 the increase in essentials is 6.6 significantly higher than the average and this is important for low-income households low-income households spend a far larger proportion of their income on the essentials this means that the income of the inflation faced by low-income households is more like 6.6 percent rather than 5.1 percent now this big increase in inflation has caused a lot of speculation that the rba the reserve bank of australia is going to increase interest rates the reserve bank doesn't like inflation and the way that it tries to dampen down price increases is by increasing interest rates how does this work well basically about 37 percent of households have a mortgage now if the rba increases interest rates then all of those households have got to spend more money on interest payments which means they have less money to spend on everything else so the point of increasing interest rates is actually to make everybody poorer so they can't buy other stuff and if they're demanding less stuff then those prices can't increase as quickly because there's less demand for them this also creates more unemployment so if there's less demand for the stuff in the economy then they need less people to make it which means unemployment is likely to go up now this is quite interesting at the moment because in the we've got both parties running around saying that they want to increase employment but if the rba is putting up interest rates they're effectively saying they think that unemployment is too low this creates an interesting situation where we might have the government trying to decrease the unemployment rate and at the same time the rba is trying to increase the unemployment rate to dampen down demand and so that's effectively like driving the car with your foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time so the latest abs figures show inflation is rising faster than at any time in the last 20 years this means that particularly low-income households are really going to feel the pinch and it could also mean that the rba puts up interest rates which will hurt mortgage holders thanks for watching if you want more content please subscribe to our channel and hit that like button [Music] you

Simplilearn,3.0,bF7whqPOhmk,[Music] inflation is a decrease in the purchasing power of money which is reflected in a general increase in the prices of goods and services in the country's economy in 1980 for example a movie ticket cost on average 2.89 by 2020 the average price of a movie ticket had risen to 10.16 with 10 you could have watched four movies in the 1980s but with that same amount of money you can only watch one movie now this decrease in movie ticket purchasing power of the us dollar is considered inflation however don't think about inflation in terms of an increase in pricing for a single item inflation refers to the broad increase in prices across a sector or an industry like the automotive food and beverages or energy business and ultimately a country's entire economy
