that negate the theory of the big bang or does it mean that there's a constant cycle of big bangs and then expansion and then recompression or yeah it could do so there's a theory called eternal inflation the idea that spacetime was around before the big bang there was doubling in size every to theus seconds which is point kns and then the idea is that draws to a close so it quite naturally sort of dies away and the expansion slows down and all the energy that was causing that expansion sort of gets dumped into space and heats it up and makes particles and that's what we call the big bank and those theories say that that slowing down just happens in little patches so most of the universe is still inflating at that insane speed and just little patches stop and they're big bangs so you get multiple universes a multiverse it's called the inflationary multiverse and we are in one of those bubbles"", 'the description of how our universe has evolved from the moment of the big bang until today is known as the big bang model but this model has some problems for example it doesn t quite tell us why the universe is so homogenous that is looks pretty much the same everywhere why it appears geometrically flat and why there are no magnetic monopoles as i discussed in the last video cosmic inflation solves these problems and accounts for much of the structure of the universe we observe today inflation occurred when the entire universe shortly after its beginning expanded exponentially fast faster than the speed of light for a very short period of time perhaps only a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second such that the volume increased by a factor of something like one implication of this cosmic inflation is that the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe may not be so homogenous in the s scientists realized that this inhomogeneity on large scales could mean that inflation ended at different times in different places and if that were true then it would mean that the universe is likely far bigger and far more complex than we realize in fact the universe we are familiar with may be only a tiny fraction of all that exists this concept is called eternal inflation and its implications are profound what is this eternal inflation and what would it imply for the true nature of reality that s coming up right now if you ve watched my videos before then you know that i like to ask big questions that sometimes don t have clear answers when this happens some viewers invoke the hand of a creator most scientists try to stay away from this idea but i recently found an inspirational science video on magellantv today s sponsor that took on the question of a creator head on in a rational way and i think you would enjoy seeing it it s called simply the cosmos and it asks the question given how much knowledge we ve gained and how much we have yet to learn is there is any evidence of a creator beyond the cosmos magellan offers thousands of fascinating documentaries like this it s a new kind of documentary service created by the film makers themselves featured topics include science history travel and technology magellan has a special offer right now for arvin ash viewers if you click the link in the description you can get free one month trial you have got nothing to lose and a world of knowledge to gain at your fingertips just by clicking the link in the description so be sure to take advantage of that we stated in the previous video that inflation occurred due to our universe having a lot of energy in the form of a scalar field the inflation field this field caused an enormous expansion of the universe but only for a split second as the universe quickly cooled it decayed into other fields and particles after this expansion the universe kept expanding but at a much slower rate using the equations of physics and knowing approximately the total energy that this field would need to have which can be calculated based on the total current energy of our universe we can approximate how long inflation should last and most models show that it would last for a miniscule amount of time something like to seconds but here s the key point about these calculations this prediction of how long inflation lasts tells us only how long it should last on average but quantum mechanics ensures that there will always be some randomness inflation could last a bit longer or shorter than expected in different parts of the universe this is analogous to radioactive decay let s take an isotope of thorium for instance thorium its half life is about day this means that if we have a kilogram of thorium after one day about kg will decay to something like protactinium the following day half the remaining kg of thorium will decay so we will be left with a kg of thorium after two days similarly the third day half of the kg will decay and so on what this means is that if you start out with atoms of thorium then after day of them will have decayed to protactinium and will remain as thorium but the nature of quantum mechanics is such we can t predict in advance which of the atoms will decay and which will not so if we pick one atom at random and wait for it to decay we could wait for day days days or more there is no telling all we know is that if we have a large number of atoms about half will decay every hours or so but we don t know which ones inflation may work similarly in the s paul steinhardt andrei linde and alexander vilenkin realized that the exponential expansion of cosmic inflation although it stopped in our part of the universe could continue without end in other unobservable parts of the universe like the concept of half life quantum uncertainty may cause on average half the volume of the expanded universe to stop inflating after about seconds but it could continue in the other half of the universe so here is the astonishing part let s say space expanded exponentially by at least x or more and stopped in one part of the universe this becomes like a bubble a bubble universe this could be our universe or any arbitrary universe but space could continue to keep expanding exponentially in another part of the universe and after another seconds it stops in another half of the just expanded universe forming another bubble universe so now we have two universes but the space between these two universes keeps expanding exponentially and as parts of this newly created space stop inflating more bubbles form but again the space between these bubbles keeps expanding exponentially steinhardt and others realized that if the if the decay of the inflation field happens slower than the rate of expansion of the universe then inflation could go on in principle forever creating more and more bubble universes now there is a big difference between the analogy of radioactive decay and inflation in radioactive decay since we have a limited amount of material and no new material is created with the passing of every half life eventually all of the material decays over time but in eternal inflation since new space is being created all the time inflation never stops this is why it s called eternal inflation for all practical purposes each of these parts where inflation stopped looks like a separate universe or bubble and is independent of what happens in other parts of the universe in fact space expands so much between them expanding faster than the speed of light no information can ever travel between the bubbles no matter how long you wait and they will never collide so they are informationally isolated from each other if the theory of eternal inflation is correct we are inside one of these bubbles and it is highly unlikely that we are in the first bubble or even in the first few bubbles given the vast number of bubbles being created at every instant we could be in any one of them so our most accepted current standard theory of the big bang goes something like this about billion years ago the big bang happened we don t know what caused it or what happened before this event but about seconds later cosmic inflation happened causing the universe to expand exponentially then it ended and then the universe continued to expand but at a much slower pace and these events largely explain what we observe in the universe today billion years later with eternal inflation the story changes to something like this we don t know what happened at the beginning but a fraction of a second later inflation happened this could have happened arbitrarily far in the past it is also possible that there may not have been a beginning at all many bubble universes formed and are continuing to form at some point within this space our bubble formed it was probably not the first and is certainly not the last inflation will continue forever continually sprouting new bubbles of universes in the space that is created within it but what we observe in our bubble billion years after its formation can be explained by the big bang model so what we think of as the start of the universe may be just the point at which inflation simply ended in our part of the universe but what the universe is on much larger scales is an unimaginably vast multiverse of universes you might be wondering what is the nature of these other universes are they like ours or are they different well no one knows for sure but it s probably a good bet that the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics would still apply since inflation is derived from quantum mechanics most physicists also think there is probably some overarching overall laws of nature that describe the entirety of the multiverse and these laws describe how the inflation field expands and how bubbles form are these universes the same as ours there is nothing in the laws of physics that requires a universe to have the same laws as ours or the same fundamental constants as ours for example the masses of fundamental particles like electrons could be different or the fine structure constant which determines the strength of the electromagnetic force could be different depending on the various combinations of fundamental constants you could have universes where no stars formed or universes where only neutrons exist or various other universes you might be thinking this sounds outlandish perhaps even preposterous prove to me that this is true well the unfortunate fact is that we will never be able to directly detect these other universes because the space between them is expanding so fast that no communication at the speed of light could occur short of creating a wormhole between one universe to another which is probably not possible we can t know whether they actually exist however the key to understanding the early universe lies in the study of high energy physics if we can replicate the energies and temperatures close to the big bang it might give us a clue as to whether eternal inflation could be correct currently the state of the art facility and one of man s greatest technological achievements the large hadron collider in switzerland can come nowhere close to the energies near the big bang for example the highest energies created in the lhc are about ev electron volts but the energies near the big bang were many magnitudes higher closer to ev so we can t simulate those conditions but perhaps a new generation of colliders will get us closer there may also be some clues about the early universe in gravitational waves our instruments are not yet sensitive enough however to detect these very weak background gravitational waves which probably fill the sky like the cosmic microwave background does these gravitational waves would have been remnants of the big bang a paper published posthumously by steven hawking and coauthor thomas hertog alludes to the idea that the background gravitational waves may hold the clues that tell us about whether potential multiverses exist the planned european space agency gravitational wave observatory lisa may be able to detect these just like in the past in when copernicus showed that the earth was not the center of the universe but that it revolved around the sun that made the sun the new center then in american astronomer harlow shapley showed that the sun was not the center of the universe and you have to remember that what we called the universe up to this point was just the milky way galaxy then in american astronomer edwin hubble showed us that our galaxy was just one of many in an ever expanding universe likewise we may someday find out that the big bang was not the beginning of everything billion years ago was simply our big bang not the big bang and that it s only a tiny blip of a bubble in a vast ocean of bubbles that is getting exponentially larger with every passing fraction of a second so it appears that in our historical search for cosmic significance the more we look the more technologically sophisticated instruments we employ the more we discover that we are perhaps even more insignificant than we ever imagined if you like this video please give us a thumbs up and if you have any questions for me or our viewers put them in the comments section i will see you in the next video my friend', ""this video is sponsored by one dream stay tuned for a special offer for arvanash viewers you probably know this familiar story in the beginning the universe was packed tightly together into a point of infinite density it then exploded into the universe we see today this is commonly thought of as the big bang astrophysicists will tell you that this image we have of the big bang is incorrect first there was no explosion like a grenade where all kinds of shrapnel goes flying away there was no substance like stars or galaxies or even atoms that went flying the entire universe itself expanded and became bigger atoms only coalesced a few hundred thousand years later as temperatures cooled and larger structures took much longer to form the big bang was not when the universe had zero size or infinite density it is just a moment in time when the universe was very hot and very dense and the big bang did not happen at some special point in space but everywhere in the known universe at the same time and contrary to popular belief the big bang model is not a theory of how the universe began science doesn't currently tell us how or why the universe came to exist or what caused it to start expanding the big bang model is about events that happened in the early universe which led to the universe we observed today that history is well understood and has been verified by evidence that we can observe even today billion years later but up until the s this model failed to explain some other observed properties of the universe which remained puzzles like why is it so homogeneous why its geometry appears flat and why there are no magnetic monopoles along came the theory of cosmic inflation proposed by alan guth and others which solved many of these puzzles and is today considered by most physicists to be a standard part of early big bang cosmology what is this theory of inflation how does it solve some of the most nagging cosmological puzzles and what caused it to happen that's coming up right now today the evidence for the big bang model is so strong that virtually no scientists seriously disputes that it's an accurate description of the history of our observable universe but some observations leading up to the s had found some mysteries that the model in its original form could not account for in order to develop into the universe that we see today the early universe had to have some very specific properties some of which seemed implausible with the early big bang model specifically the questions left unanswered in the model were why was the early universe so uniform why is the universe so close to being geometrically flat and why do we not see any magnetic monopoles which could theoretically exist in american physicist alan guth wrote a paper in which he proposed the idea of cosmic inflation which could solve these apparent mysteries this is not the kind of inflation that makes your money worth less it means a sudden expansion the simplest version of the theory of inflation says that the universe expanded exponentially fast faster than the speed of light near its earliest history from what is believed to be the beginning of the universe from about to the negative seconds after the big bang to to the negative seconds during this time it expanded a factor of at least to the going from being very small to being exponentially large in comparison you might be thinking i thought things couldn't move faster than the speed of light einstein's theory of special relativity shows that this speed limit applies to things moving within space but not the expansion of space itself so this is permissible note that not all physicists agree that the beginning that is the point when time first started t equals zero is the same as the beginning of the big bang some physicists believe that the big bang happened after inflation around to the negative seconds also note that some descriptions of inflation say something like the universe started out smaller than an atom and then expanded to the size of a grapefruit you should keep in mind that these analogies can be misleading because they imply that the universe has an edge it doesn't there's only the universe and nothing else there is no outside and while we're at it let's dispel some other common misunderstandings about the beginning of the universe the idea that the universe started from a singularity that is a point of infinite density and heat is not correct it's purely due to mathematical extrapolation it's like getting a zero in the denominator of a mathematical equation it is undefined and represents the limit of our knowledge a singularity is probably not a physical thing and is really not what the big bang theory says it is part of the standard model of cosmology basically what the theory says is that the universe today is bigger than it was yesterday and is much bigger than it was a billion years ago so as you extrapolate back the universe gets smaller and smaller denser and denser and hotter and hotter so as you keep going you get to a very small volume of space which is very dense and very hot at some point in this extrapolation our equations stop working because the volume becomes zero but there were probably some other laws of physics that applied at this stage perhaps some kind of quantum gravity that is gravity at infinitesimally small scales we don't have such a theory yet this is something that physicists are feverishly working on along the same lines the universe today is expanding but galaxies aren't actually moving at that expansion rate only the space between galaxies is becoming larger and only on very large scales gravity also plays a role so that on smaller scales gravity still holds stars together within a galaxy and certain nearby galaxies are still attracted to each other like the andromeda galaxy is to our milky way galaxy while the whole universe may come from a tiny volume of space cosmic inflation would have caused all points within that space to expand and this expansion or inflation happened everywhere in space there is no center of the universe or location every point moved away from every other point expansion faster than the speed of light during inflation also means that these points while they may have been causally connected initially would have moved apart after inflation such that they became causally disconnected this is because causality is limited to the speed of light no information can travel faster than the speed as a consequence of this there are certain parts of the universe that we will never be able to see or detect in any way because any light or gravity coming from it will never reach us now let's see how inflation could explain the three problems of the big bang model the observed homogeneity the flatness issue and no observed magnetic monopoles issue when we look out into space we see that the universe on large scales is pretty much uniform the universe is extremely homogeneous and isotropic which is just a physics jargon for saying it appears roughly the same everywhere you look this can also be seen in the cosmic microwave background or cmb where the tiny differences you see on this image represent temperature fluctuations of at most only kelvin or less than one ten thousandth of one degree to see how inflation explains why the early universe was so uniform let's imagine that before inflation the universe was completely random maybe in one place the density was very high and a fraction of a millimeter off to the side the density was very low you can imagine it like the surface of a deflated balloon there may be tiny imperfections like different thicknesses and wrinkles randomly distributed on it now imagine that this balloon is suddenly inflated to a very large size a tiny fraction of a second later the wrinkle in the balloon surface gets smoothed out any density differences of the balloon's skin become diluted this is analogous to what happened during inflation as a tiny volume increased by at least to the x now let's look at the flatness problem imagine living like an ant on the surface of a very small balloon it would be a two dimensional world but if the balloon was tiny enough it might be obvious to you that this surface was curved and that you were living in a closed or curved universe however if that ball was expanded to the sides of the earth it would appear flat to you even though it is still a sphere on much larger scales now scale that up to human size and the ball being much larger than even the observable universe to you it would appear to be flat as far as you could see even though it might have been obviously curved to start with inflation stretches any initial curvature of the three dimensional universe to near flatness we don't know if the universe is flat but if there is curvature it is so small that we can't measure it with our current technology note that when i say curvature it would be an overall curvature of the universe in four dimensions this is not easy to visualize so we have to visualize it as a d curvature of a d balloons surface a closed curvature for the universe would mean that two parallel lines would eventually converge in our d universe just like two parallel lines on the d surface of a balloon converge how does inflation solve the monopole problem the fact that we can observe no magnetic monopoles in the universe well monopoles can only theoretically form at very high temperatures the kinds of temperatures that were only present during the big bang but once they formed they should be stable enough to survive the idea is that inflation would have quickly cooled down the universe because of rapid expansion and only monopoles created prior to inflation would then continue to exist in the universe but during inflation the density of monopoles would drop exponentially so their abundance would drop to undetectable levels because they would exist in such low densities imagine that just before inflation there were a thousand monopoles and they were all packed into a cubic meter of space a fraction of a second later those monopoles were spread out in a region to the cubic meters across this would make them so rare that we may never detect them now as the cmb attests the universe is not completely smooth we can see that there are small imperfections small temperature differences this is called the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background you might say well doesn't this ruin the idea of inflation if the universe isn't completely uniform no these small anisotropies are exactly what we would expect inflation only makes the large scales like the cmb look uniform but the small anisotropics can actually explain the origin of the observed structure in the universe prior to inflation the universe we see today was microscopic the quantum fluctuations within the density of matter could have expanded to astronomical scales during inflation and this is what we see across the universe as the higher density regions condensed into stars galaxies and galaxy clusters now the big question you may be asking is how did the universe start what was responsible for inflation this is not well understood it is thought that there may have been a scalar inflation field during the time of the big bang now what is a scalar field as an analogy imagine a room with a fireplace in it every point in that room will have a temperature associated with it so if you were to measure the temperature anywhere in that room it will have some kind of distribution we would be measuring just a magnitude of the temperature this is akin to a scalar field it has only a magnitude now imagine that same room with a giant magnet in the middle of it every point in that room will have a magnetic field which will not only have a magnitude but also a direction in other words if you had a charged particle or small magnet somewhere in that room that object would experience a force that has not only a magnitude but also a different direction depending on its location in the room this is like a vector field it has a magnitude and a direction magnetic fields and gravitational fields are vector fields like this the higgs field and the inflation field are scalar fields analogous to the temperature in the room from a theoretical point of view assuming that an inflation field existed we can show this field with the following diagram in the very early very hot universe the inflation field would have had some value at a point a this would have been the lowest energy density that the field could be in at that high temperature and energies of the universe at that time the theoretical inflatance or particles of the inflation field would have remained at this point however point a would not have been the true vacuum but a false vacuum because as temperatures cooled the field formed a lower energy potential at point c since a was not the lowest point in terms of energy density it is called a false vacuum the natural place for the field to be as the universe cooled and got to lower temperatures and energies was actually c the lowest energy density of the field all natural systems tend towards their lowest energy state so when the inflation field is stuck at a it will tend towards c but before it can get there it has to overcome a small barrier b this can be accomplished with the help of quantum tunneling this can allow the field to overcome the barrier at b and drop down to its lowest energy state at c when the energy difference between point a and point c becomes very large larger than any other energy in the universe inflation starts and when the field reaches the lowest minimum energy density in the potential at point c inflation comes to a stop this is a very short process because as i said earlier inflation lasts only from about to the negative seconds to about to the negative seconds after the beginning so the scalar field causes the almost instantaneous exponential expansion that we call cosmic inflation as this field reaches its lowest potential inflation ends and it decays into other fields and particles after this event the universe continues to expand but in the slower way that the original big bang model described so inflation theory solved several problems in one fell swoop in my next video i'll cover an even more fascinating aspect of inflation and that is the theory of eternal inflation this theory if correct would mean that our universe is but one of a near endless myriad of universes most of which are unimaginably bigger than ours this could also actually explain why our universe is like the way it is so stay tuned for that i'd like to give a big shout out to professor gary felder of smith college

would have remained at this point however point a would not have been the true vacuum but a false vacuum because as temperatures cooled the field formed a lower energy potential at point c since a was not the lowest point in terms of energy density it is called a false vacuum the natural place for the field to be as the universe cooled and got to lower temperatures and energies was actually c the lowest energy density of the field all natural systems tend towards their lowest energy state so when the inflation field is stuck at a it will tend towards c but before it can get there it has to overcome a small barrier b this can be accomplished with the help of quantum tunneling this can allow the field to overcome the barrier at b and drop down to its lowest energy state at c when the energy difference between point a and point c becomes very large larger than any other energy in the universe inflation starts when the field reaches the lowest minimum energy density in the potential at point c inflation comes to a stop this is a very short process because as i said earlier inflation lasts only from about seconds to about seconds after the beginning so the scalar field causes the almost instantaneous exponential expansion that we call cosmic inflation as the field reaches its lowest potential inflation ends and it decays into other fields and particles after this event the universe continues to expand but in the slower way that the original big bang model described so inflation theory solves several problems in one fell swoop in my next video i will cover an even more fascinating aspect of inflation and that is the theory of eternal inflation this theory if correct would mean that our universe is but one of a near endless myriad of universes most of which are unimaginably bigger than ours this could also actually explain why our universe is like the way it is so stay tuned for that i d like to give a big shout out to professor gary felder of smith college who inspired this video he has a wonderful course on wondrium today s sponsor it s a detailed college level part course on the big bang theory including cosmic inflation and all its implications if my

assets everything you own to some rich guy and then you took a massive loan from him and you gave the money back to him so now you're in debt to him he owns everything how can you not be poor and the answer is you can't all right so today we're going to do a nice educational one uh topical about the main issues which people are worried about today that we get asked about a lot which are inflation interest rates and house prices often viewed i think as separate concerns but they're very very linked they're very related so i think if we cover all of these and the way they're related it can really help people to understand how the economy works and what's happening now right so we're going to start with inflation so the first thing is we've covered this before but i'll go over it quickly i believe and i've said this many times on the channel that the inflation was largely caused by the enormous amount of money given out by this government and governments all over the world during covid uh the amounts are truly enormous billion in this country uk which is pounds per adult eight trillion dollars in the us which is about dollars per adult huge amounts of money given out that amount of money has to end up somewhere ends up in the bank accounts of private individuals largely wealthier private individuals which means huge huge nobody is denying this by the way this is generally accepted enormous accumulation of cash by richer individuals in the last three years during covid which is the reason why i said in the first video on this channel that when we come out of covid we will probably see a big jump in inflation because there would have been this massive cash accumulation with rich individuals okay um that has not generally been the mainstream media explanation of inflation and they've been generally saying it's because of sort of an anonymous after effects of covid which never really explained in much detail and of course the ukraine war i'm not denying that the war in ukraine has caused inflation especially with specifically with energy that is a part of it as well but i think a big part of it is this massive cash accumulation during covid if you give a huge amount of cash out what you essentially do is you devalue the currency because most people especially the rich have huge amount more money more money going around they can buy more things they can push prices up prices go up and you know we predicted it in advance and it happened what does that mean going forward okay so if i'm right and it was largely caused by this huge amount of money given out by the government you would expect a kind of relatively sharp jump in prices and then for prices to start going up much more slowly because the government gave a huge amount of money out in a short period of time and now they are still running a deficit higher than pre covid and that is because basically there's been a massive increase in poverty since covid because of the inflation which means the government is now forced to for example subsidise people's energy which has cost the government they're forced to provide more poverty benefits because people are struggling so the government gave a huge amount of money out and now they have to keep giving money up at a much slower rate so what i would expect to happen is a big increase in prices and then for prices to keep going up but not at this rapid rate so we've seen the big increase and what i expect happen now is that prices will will slow down they will keep going up because the government is still giving money out but they will not keep going up at the rapid rate so we will see a big fall in inflation um almost certainly it's important that people understand that a fall in inflation does not mean a fall in prices right inflation is the rate of increase in prices so prices jumped a lot they will keep going up but that will slow down massively um inflation will probably fall to something like six seven percent maybe even lower this year that is just simply because the government is not giving so much money out the government will try and take credit for that but it's important to remember that if prices are still going up six seven percent a year then you know life is still getting harder life is still getting worse for you and the fall in inflation is really a fall in the rate of decrease of your living standards it's not really something for the government to be proud of okay so that's inflation covered for now inflation will probably normalise right i think it's because of the huge amount of money given out that that rich people still have um other people think it's because of other things um let's move on to interest rates so interest rates have risen significantly here in the uk they're up to four and a quarter now financial markets first thing to say is financial markets think that we are nearing the top now they think that interest rates will probably peak at something like four and a half maybe four and three quarters which means another just or increases in interest rates this year um i suspect that'll probably be right in the short term then interest rates will start to slowly come down now there's been a lot of discussion about interest rates and i want to talk about this one because i think i think the situation is quite interesting right there's been a lot of criticism especially from the left people saying what the hell is the bank of england doing raising interest rates um and that's understandable because when the bank raises interest rates your mortgage rate goes up i think a lot of people are seeing massive increase in their mortgage rates it's causing a lot of problems um it increases the interest that the government has to pay on it's government debt government debt is massively increased in the last three years it's very large it's about of gdp i think it's you know something like pounds per person it's a lot um they have to pay a higher interest rate if you have a mortgage you have to pay a higher interest rate um and people are understandably super stressed about that right and they're turning around to the bank of england and they're saying 'well why are you doing this because you're hurting us you're hurting us you're hurting the economy' and i think this provides opportunity for a really interesting discussion so the first thing to say is from my perspective the inflation has been caused by the government giving money out that has ended up with rich people and we discussed this exactly in the first video on the channel where we predicted the inflation right where we said if during covid the government is going to give billion pounds to the rich the only way to avoid a crisis in inflation and inequality because that cash distribution increases both of those things is to take money back from the rich through taxation policy you see that's symmetrical if i give you money then the way to reverse that and avoid the consequences of that are to then tax money from you okay but that's not what we're doing right what we're doing is the government has given money out which has ended up with the rich and then rather than taxing money back from the rich the central bank the bank of england is increasing interest rates and this is because economists when they think of inflation they always think of interest rates this is what happens in economists minds if inflation is too high raise interest rates if inflation is too low lower interest rates these are like the articles of faith of being an economist they're really connected and they tend not to think in terms of fiscal policy so in economists minds they have these these ideas of two levers that rule the economy one is fiscal policy and that is government taxation and expenditure so during covid the government run a massive deficit that means they spent way more than they taxed that is what they would call a fiscal stimulus it's pouring money in in terms of government spending that's fiscal policy monetary policies is basically central bank interest rates it includes quantitative easing which we've covered before but i think to keep things simple let's just talk about interest rates and that is you lower the interest rate to speed the economy up you raise the interest rate to speed the economy down it's important to recognise that these are two different things all right and both of them can affect inflation so if the government starts spending a ton of money and during covid most of it's printed money that will push inflation up and if the central bank starts slashing interest rates that will also push inflation up but they're different things right and i think the most important thing to understand if you take anything away from this video is that we are clearly using the wrong policy to fix the inflation because if we cause the inflation by giving money to the rich then the way to fix it is to take money from the rich if we try to fix it by raising interest rates what does that mean well interest rates are the money that is paid by borrowers in the economy to lenders in the economy and i remember we've covered this on the channel before that for every borrower there is a lender for every lender there is a borrower okay it's always perfectly matched you can't borrow money from nobody you can't owe money to nobody okay so really when the central bank raises interest rates what they are doing is they are benefiting the lenders so who are lenders lenders are people with large amounts of money who lend money out you know largely it's wealthy individuals you know sometimes it goes through your bank so if you have a huge amount of cash in the bank your bank lends that money to government your bank lends that money to mortgage borrowers if you have a lot of money in your pension your pension fund lends that money to the government lends that money to mortgage borrowers right so people with large amounts of cash benefit when interest rates go up and the people who lose are people who have large amounts of borrowing which is the government first and foremost and people with mortgages people with large mortgages which is largely younger homeowners also it doesn't include homeowners from rich families who don't have to use mortgages right so when you raise interest rates often you are benefiting rich people because they have a lot of cash and your disadvantaging the government and mortgagees people who have mortgages that is increasing inequality and it's not as simple as that right because there are some poorer people have all of their money in cash you may feel that they benefit there might be some rich people have a large amount of debt for example i have a large amount of debt as part of my sort of trading portfolio but in general when you raise interest rates you're moving money from borrowers which is mortgage holders and the government to lenders which is rich individuals especially older rich individuals so when the government has given money out it's caused two things to happen a massive increase in inequality a decrease in the value of the currency which we see as inflation if it wanted to perfectly offset that then it would tax the rich back but for some reason which as you know i'm constantly maddened about taxing the rich has never really been seriously in the discussion here even though we've seen a massive increase in the wealth of the rich so instead we've gone for the default which is raising interest rates now raising interest rates does increase the value of the currency so the one half of it which is the devaluation of the currency you are fighting by raising interest rates but the other half which was an increase in inequality raising interest rates makes that worse right because you're forcing borrowers who are often not wealthy families if you're wealthy you wouldn't take a mortgage and the government which means the taxpayer which means ordinary working people because as we know the very wealthy don't pay high rates of tax the taxpayer and mortgage holders have to pay more money to the cash holders which are the people who've accumulated huge amounts of cash during covid which is the rich so in trying to fix with monetary policy by the bank of england a problem which was caused the fiscal or taxation policy by the government you've ended up trying to fix a crisis of inequality by more inequality so that that means that the long run situation for the economy and for for inequality is extremely bad but it will succeed eventually in bringing inflation down and this i think is there'll be people who there will be some people who won't like me saying this it will be unpopular with some there's been a lot of criticism from the left of the central bank for their interest rate policy they're saying you know why are you raising interest rates it's hurting people if the bank of england kept interest rates at zero the pound would have collapsed in currency markets the pound would be worth half of what it is now we'd be seeing an inflation crisis and i mean it would be very similar to what happened after the trussonomics disaster in autumn so i think people who are pointing at the bank of england boe and saying this is your fault listen i've got no love lost for the bank of england or andrew bailey um i think that they have no choice but to do this the problem is because the government and the broader economics discussion in the media have said nothing about taxing the rich which would be the correct way to fix it the central bank has no option but to raise the interest rates you know if we i think an interesting thought experiment is to sit and think what if we reversed the cash distributions of the last three years what if we went to every single person in the top of the country and said we want tax that would be a reversal like that it seems crazy but that is what we have done in the last years we've distributed to the richest million people in the country each person right so if we took that back you would see a collapse in inflation a massive collapses these people desperately tried to raise that cash right so the interest rates had to go up because we have refused to have the discussion about taxing the rich and if you give a ton of money to the rich inflation will increase if you refuse to take the money back the only option central banks have to try and keep inflation is to raise interest rates and it will happen but in terms of looking forward i believe that the inflation will come down when it safely quickly which means that the central banks including the bank of england the fed the european central bank ecb will stop raising rates relatively soon um i think that once that inflation slows down you will start to see how severe the economic weakness is underneath how big the increase in poverty is and you'll probably start seeing in my opinion interest rates start to fall relatively quickly but that that depends on whether there's a bit of a balance here right because because we've seen such a big increase in poverty it creates creates pressure on governments to do more deficit spending and pump more money in if governments are forced to pump more money in that could keep inflation higher over the long term and i think what you're seeing here is kind of the death throws of an economy which has given up on tax taxing the rich so if you cannot tax the rich and the rich have all the assets then you end up in a situation where whenever there's a crisis the rich get a ton of money and you can't get it back so the only option you have is to raise interest rates and that causes more poverty which means you have to give more money to the rich it's a question basically you're trying to solve the question of how do you prevent poverty when you are giving all of the assets to a group of people that you can get nothing back from it's almost a question of imagine you gave your house and all of your assets everything you own to some rich guy and then you took a massive loan from him and you gave the money back to him so now you're in debt to him he owns everything how can you not be poor and the answer is you can't so if you keep trying to provide living standards without the ability to tax the people who increasingly own everything it's not possible so you will continue to see this balancing act between the government has to spend a deficit which keeps inflation high but i think what you will see in this country i think the conservative government has a big political problem with high interest rates and that takes us to our next point which is house prices so how do you buy a house in a world where you're poor and the rich have everything the answer is you borrow the money from the rich and that that's mortgages and mortgages have been the way that we have squared this circle for the last years in this country which is the conservative government has quite a political need for people to own property because private renters and social renters almost never vote conservative um they need house prices to rise because that's the only reason that older people feel comfortable because the house prices are rising so they need to keep people owning property but inequality is rising and rising the middle class are losing their assets so how do we keep ordinary people owning property when inequality is rising because rising inequality of wealth means you lose your assets but we need you to lose your assets but keep your house how is that possible the answer is increasing debt so you can keep your house and you can just get more and more and more and more in debt to the rich that way you stay a property owner so you keep voting conservative but you become poorer and poorer generation after generation so it's really mortgages and debt i like the magic solution that works for the government and that has been working for them for the last years quite well politically because the rich get richer and richer because you owe them more and more and more money but you keep your house so everybody's winning the rich get richer you get poorer but you keep voting for them because you're a homeowner and what you want is for asset prices to go up it's really really good for the conservatives and it's really bad for people in general and this is why higher interest rates are a disaster for the conservatives because they need ordinary people to be taking huge amounts of debt and huge amounts of debt are not affordable for ordinary people at interest rates of six seven eight percent which is what a lot of mortgage rates have gone up to right so they need interest rates to come down they need interest rates to come down desperately so i think what they will do and what you're seeing them doing is they will try their best to run as much as possible an extreme austerity government in the next year and a half in a desperate attempt to bring inflation down quickly so that interest rates come down and as soon as interest rates come down you will start to see those house prices go up because of the thing we mentioned at the beginning of the video which is that billion pounds which has been given out by the government the last three years is still sitting in the bank accounts of the rich and this is the big conflict we have right the rich have all that money and what would the rich people do with money they want to buy assets so house prices want to go up but rich people themselves don't want to go out and buy a ton of houses right because buying houses is a hassle you know you need to manage tenants super rich people don't want to be having to fix poor people's boilers things like this they don't want to be involved in stuff like that so what they normally do is they lend the money out they lend the money out but suddenly poor people can't afford to borrow the money anymore so it's created this it's created this two forces in house prices which is on the one hand house prices should be going up because the rich have got a ton of money and it's important to be clear house prices have gone up by about since the beginning of covid and now they've come down about so that force of the rich having a ton of money push house prices up but now the mechanism by which rich people buy houses and i think this is an interesting thing to consider mortgages are in a very real way the way that rich people buy houses so i've got half a million pounds and you've got nothing and you want a house there's two ways i can give you housing i can buy the house myself and i can rent it to you or i can lend you the half a million pounds you can buy the house and instead of paying rent you pay me interest financially it's very similar if you think about it in both cases i provide all of the money for the house to be bought and in one case you pay me rent and other case you pay me interest so really mortgages are the way that the rich buy houses for the poor but that channel has become blocked because the poor can no longer afford the interest um so i think there are two things that can possibly happen here and the way it will play out will depend on the country one is in this country i think the government will do everything they can to bring inflation down but that will come at the cost of really crushing the economy and crushing ordinary people um i think the way they'll hope to survive that is by making a bit of room to like throw a load of money immediately before the election they will try to bring the interest rates down and as soon as interest rates come down then you will see this flood of money that the rich have again they continue to push house prices up even though they've already gone up i think they can go up a lot more if you look at after house prices basically doubled over the next years and i think they can do that again so if the interest rates come down then this channel will open up again the interesting question is what if interest rates don't come down which is what could happen if governments are forced to keep running big deficits in that case you'll have the question of how do the rich people buy their houses when they can't lend the money out and i think what you will see if that happens is the rich will start buying the houses through corporations and you will start to see much more corporate landlording so i lived in japan for a long time and i think increasingly in the us you're seeing rather than the rich lending the pool of money via mortgages the rich pull their money together into corporations so there's i think it's is it blackrock or is it blackstone in the u s it's a massive company which owns a huge amount of housing rich people pool their money together in corporations the corporations buy the houses and the corporations lend the money out because it's quite interesting at the moment you're seeing rents go through the roof at the same time as house prices go down and the rich are sitting on a huge pile of cash so it's a it's a massive investment opportunity for wealthy people with cash because rents are super high and they've got a ton of money and the prices are cheap so the rich should be buying these houses and bringing the rent in but the problem simply is rich people are you know too lazy to go and buy houses right and it's becoming more it's it's cumbersome right rich people don't want to be becoming massive buy to let landlords right so but either way the money is there and that will force house prices up in the long term and i think what you're just seeing is the the mortgage channel get blocked in the meantime um but what you would inevitably see in any case is the massive gift of cash to the rich will manifest in increased inequality of real assets either through much higher mortgages which means a much higher amount of debt from ordinary families to the rich we've already seen a much higher debt from the government to the rich and what you will see is increased direct holding of properties i think it's important to realise when that mortgage channel gets blocked it provides a massive opportunity for rich people who can just pay cash they don't need a mortgage they can just buy cash at the cheaper price get in that massive increase in rental income rents are going absolutely through the roof and they can profit from that so every single step of the way covid management meaning massive cash transfer from the government to the rich higher interest rates meaning higher debt payments from mortgagees and the government to the rich and falling house prices at the same time as high mortgage rates means cheaper access to housing if you have the cash which only rich people do every single step of the way is benefiting the rich and hurting ordinary middle class families and there's nothing that will prevent this if we don't start discussing more seriously taxation of the rich so to make clear the predictions you know inflation will come down um it will still be positive for a while interest rates will stop going up and i think they'll probably start coming down it might take a year or two um house prices they're clearly falling at the moment even though they're still significantly higher than pre covid i don't think that will last i think as soon as interest rates start falling they will start going up and even if they don't you'll just start seeing more more corporate land lording i know these are pessimistic predictions uh we get a lot of people saying that these are pessimistic predictions but this is what happens if you don't text the rich and if you don't want bad outcomes you cannot allow inequality to get higher and higher so support the channel we're always pushing for higher taxation of the richest and that's you know that's the only way we're going to prevent these things i know that these are not good for ordinary families we can't fix it without without improving taxation policy so let's do that okay thats all"", ""music you can afford anything you just can't afford everything every choice that you make is a trade off against something else and that doesn't just apply to your money that applies to your time your focus your energy your attention to any limited resource that you need to manage saying yes to something implicitly means turning away all other opportunities and that opens up two critical questions first what matters most not what does society say ought to matter most but what is truly a priority a value in your life that's the first question and the second question is how do you put that into action how do you make decisions that reflect that which matters most answering these two questions is a lifetime practice and that's what this podcast is here to explore and facilitate my name is paula pant i'm the host of the afford anything podcast and in today's episode we're going to take a deep dive into understanding inflation it's a hot topic it's been on everyone's mind it's the subject of news reports headlines cocktail party conversation what is inflation today's episode will be an explainer episode to peel back the layers of the onion and understand what this concept truly is now we're gonna do that for the first two thirds of the show and then the final one third of the show we're going to close out with something completely different in the final one third of the show i will be playing a speech that i made at the economy conference which is a conference that draws a lot of people who are chasing financial independence so that's what's in store for the final third of the show but for the first two thirds of the show let's understand inflation first a few disclaimers before we get started number one we are not trying to predict the future we are simply trying to make sense of the present so this discussion about inflation is educational not predictive and nothing i say is meant to be taken as a device only as background for educational and entertainment purposes number two i am not an econ professor nor do i play one on tv i trained as a journalist many years ago and today i'm a finance podcaster which is a polite way of saying i'm a person with access to the internet so take that for what it's worth now with those two disclaimers out of the way let's get started and we're going to break this discussion into five parts part one what is inflation what's the cause of inflation part two what are the effects of inflation and how are different types of assets impacted part three how is inflation measured part four historic examples and part five the relationship between inflation and unemployment all right let's get started part one what is inflation and what causes it there are some who define inflation as too much money chasing too few goods that's a cute description certainly a sticky one but it is a description that overly emphasizes the demand side of the causes of inflation so rather than describe it as too much money chasing too few goods the more technical description is that inflation is what takes place when the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy and this results in a decline in purchasing power for a given currency in other words goods and services cost more than they used to so if the cause of inflation is that the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy that presents an obvious follow up question which is how does the money supply grow there are three common ways that it can happen number one the money supply can grow from the printing and issuance of new money number two the money supply can grow when a government decides to loan a new money into the banking system by purchasing government bonds and number three the money supply can grow if a government decides to legally devalue the currency now in addition to those three ways that the money supply can grow printing money loaning money and legally devaluing the currency the other element of inflation is not just the supply of money but the velocity of money so the supply of money is what we just discussed new money gets pumped into the system through one or a combination of the three mechanisms that we just described but the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands the speed of transaction if a bunch of money is pumped into the system but everyone hides it under their mattress this doesn't create the same type of inflationary pressure as new money getting pumped into the system and then buyers and sellers exchanging that money for goods and services at high velocity the supply of money is the attribute that a government can directly control the velocity of money however can only indirectly be influenced through the mechanisms that create or detract from consumer confidence and investor confidence so how does that confidence the willingness of consumers to spend how does that contribute to inflation in order to answer that question we first must take a step back and ask ourselves how exactly is it that both the money supply and the velocity of money have an impact in inflation what is the mechanism through which that takes place the answer to that question is that there are three common mechanisms one takes place when demand outpaces supply the growth in money supply leads to consumer confidence in other words people have more money so they want to spend it but production capabilities can't match that demand when that happens when demand outpaces supply we wind up in a situation where we have too much money chasing too few goods resulting in higher prices however that is only one of three mechanisms the second mechanism takes place when manufacturers suppliers retailers when they face higher production costs this happens when there's some disruption that makes the cost of raw materials or the cost of production rise and that has a downstream effect on the retail costs of goods and services so for example the cost of copper the cost of lumber the cost of steel if there is some disruption either to the acquisition of raw materials or to the processing the transportation the production capabilities or supply chain capabilities if there are any upstream disruptions then the producers in the middle face longer wait times and higher costs and this gets passed down to the end consumer that's the second mechanism and then the third mechanism is what's known as the wage price spiral this takes place when prices begin to rise which means life gets more expensive as a result workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising prices businesses raise wages and raise salaries in order to meet that worker demand and in order to attract and retain talent and businesses then have to raise the price of their own goods and services in order to pay their higher labor costs this creates a self reinforcing spiral known as the wage price spiral so that's the third mechanism now if much of what i've talked about sounds familiar it's because this is the story that we have all lived over the last two years on the demand side when we went into shutdowns in services like concerts massages haircuts those services were no longer available and so consumers turned their demand away from services and towards goods in addition stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits grew the money supply and kept consumer confidence strong further fueling this demand for goods but the production capabilities and the supply chain capabilities for producers to produce those goods could not meet this added demand in addition to that in many sectors in order for producers to be able to increase their production capacity they either need to make very large capital expenditure investments that require a long lead time as is the case with lumber lumber milling or producers didn't have the confidence that this demand would persist after the shutdowns ended and so for certain items producers felt it too risky to invest in enhanced capex if that means that they might end up in a situation two years in the future where they are over producing once this temporary boost in demand subsides now on top of all of that we've talked about the wage price spiral but fueling that wage price spiral was a labor shortage as more people opted out of the workforce either because they need to homeschool their children they need to care for an ill or elderly family member or they received enough in various forms of non wage payment that they could afford to opt out of the workforce and so the labor shortage amplified the wage price spiral and so you can see what's happened in the last two years is that when we talk about these three mechanisms that fuel inflation one being demand outpaces supply two being higher production costs and three being the wage price spiral there have been other inflationary periods where one or two of those factors have driven inflation but in the last two years we have experienced pronounced effects in all three and so this wraps up part one of the five key parts of this episode part one being where we address the question what is inflation and what causes it and to recap the highlights inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services and a decrease in the purchasing power of a given currency and it happens when the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy the money supply grows through the printing and issuance of new money through the loaning of new money into the system and through legally devaluing the currency the money supply however is just one of two factors that influence inflation the other being the velocity of money so the supply of money and the velocity of money both play a role and they play a role through three mechanisms demand outpaces supply higher production costs and the wage price spiral so that's the recap of part one all right let's move to part two what are the effects of inflation part one we discussed cause part two we're discussing effect and let's start with the good news some degree of inflation is desirable inflation spurs investment because investors look to various assets like equities commodities real estate in order to beat inflation inflation also spurs spending because the knowledge that cash tomorrow will be worth less than cash today is a motivator to spend now so it's healthy for a society to have a small controlled degree of inflation times in developed economies like the united states a target inflation rate of around two percent is considered just the right dose in more rapidly developing economies that inflation rate can notch up a bit higher india has set its target inflation rate at four percent with a plus minus two percent on either end so they've set a target range of between two to six percent so different nations set different inflation targets because inflation does produce some healthy benefits into the system but even in the best of times inflation needs to be managed carefully and every time a government introduces new money into a financial system the first order effect is felt based on how where and when that new money is issued and this leads to a discussion around something called the cantelon effect quick pronunciation note some people call it the cantillon effect others pronounce it the cantelon effect i'll be calling it cantelon it was named for an economist who lived in the th century named richard cantelon he observed that when new money enters into a system when the money supply grows it does not have an immediate universal effect on all prices in all industries impacting all people instead it has a localized effect and the closer you are to that injection of liquidity the faster you will feel that effect so the cantalon effect states that prices and inflation will rise at different rates for different market sectors which is a concept known as relative inflation now what this means is that those who are closest to the source of that money the source of the new liquidity that's entering the system will enjoy a higher quality of life and will have the opportunity to generate the largest amount of wealth as a result of their proximity to this liquidity that's entering the system stated simply when new money enters a system the people or companies who can get their hands on it first can take advantage of this new money and make investments and allow this money to compound and grow and they can do that before this injection of new money into the financial system has time to spread across the entire system in other words they can make investments before inflation becomes obvious everywhere and that's why decisions around how where and when new money enters the system is so critically important think back to the beginning of the pandemic when individuals and households were receiving stimulus checks remember that first stimulus check it was a huge input of new money into the system and when those stimulus checks came out a lot of individual investors opened up accounts on robinhood and started investing their stimis the cultural phenomenon of meme stocks and stonks the reddit run up of gamestop and amc theaters all of that happened when new money entered into the financial system but inflation hadn't kicked in yet and so those who received that new money were able to invest it or use it to speculate now oftentimes banks or financial institutions are the recipients of the new money supply because as we discussed earlier one way that the money supply grows is by loaning new money into the banking system by purchasing bonds once the banking system has money they're able to lend it out both to businesses such as small businesses looking for loans and to consumers such as retail home buyers and the people in companies who were able to get those loans are poised to benefit significantly as inflation picks up because inflation is good for borrowers particularly good for borrowers with fixed rate loans because when you borrow money and you have a fixed interest rate and that rate is less than the rate of inflation then over time you repay that loan with cheaper and cheaper dollars so inflation is great for borrowers this is a wonderful time to have a fixed rate mortgage or a few of them if you're a rental property investor but it's bad for savers because savings are eroded inflation is good for exporters because exporters can produce something while paying the production costs associated with a weaker us dollar they can then sell that item overseas and collect payment in a stronger currency and they can benefit from that enhanced spread so inflation is good for exporters but it's bad for importers because a weaker us dollar means that foreign made goods are more expensive another way in the u s every dollar becomes less valuable and so what does that mean for assets how are different types of assets impacted well tangible assets that are valued in currency like real estate gold commodities these are inflation hedges and particularly if you have a tangible asset like real estate and a fixed rate loan as a borrower who has borrowed money in order to acquire that tangible asset you now have a fantastic setup in an inflationary environment not only do you own a tangible asset you also are a borrower in a period of high inflation so it's a double win now in contrast to tangible assets paper assets assets that are denominated in currency like cash or bonds these types of assets are eroded by inflation so in an inflationary environment tangible assets good paper assets bad borrowing money good saving money i don't want to say bad saving money is a value that i espouse but yeah inflation is bad for savers broadly speaking stocks and real estate have historically been great hedges against inflation but not all stocks are created equal growth stocks in particular are negatively affected now what do i mean when i say growth stocks let's pause let's take a step back we'll zoom out stocks equities generally are classified based on size style and location so when i say size i'm talking large cap mid cap small cap when i say location i'm talking u s international emerging markets frontier markets and when i say style i'm talking about growth stocks value stocks or a blend those are three common classifications for equities now let's take a close up look at the style classification growth stocks are stocks that seem to be very promising for the future so they may not necessarily be turning a profit right now their numbers today might not look that great but their future prospects seem optimistic enough that investors are willing to make a bet that these stocks these growth stocks will outperform the market over time this is in contrast to the alternate style value stocks which are stocks that typically tend to be performing well today but the investors decide are trading at a cost that is less than what they're actually worth in other words with value stocks investors believe that the market has undervalued the worth of a given company the market has underpriced that company and so value stocks are sought after based on their current performance and their current price relative to their current performance by contrast growth stocks are sought after based on the expectation of their future performance and this is where inflation starts to fiddle with those numbers because when dollars become less valuable the present value of those future dollars is also reduced and as a result growth stocks tend to take a hit in an inflationary environment now tech stocks tend to represent a lot of growth stocks and the tech sector also represents the biggest stocks talk large cap the biggest stocks in the index so among the biggest stocks in the s p we find apple microsoft amazon facebook google tesla and nvidia all of which are tech stocks all of which are among the biggest stocks in the overall s p now just because they're tech stocks doesn't mean they're necessarily considered growth stocks that's disclaimer number one that i want to make disclaimer number two that i want to make is that sometimes a growth investor and a value investor might both buy the same stock for different reasons philip fisher is one of the most acclaimed american investors of the th century he is sometimes referred to as the father of growth investing and ironically his son is a value investor and he wrote about times when both he and his son would purchase exactly the same stock but philip fisher would come to that decision through a decision making framework that prioritized growth stocks and his son would come to that same decision through a decision making framework that prioritized value investing so that's the second disclaimer that i want to throw out there not all tech stocks are growth stocks and some growth stocks are also really good value stock picks with that said it is also the case that there's a lot of overlap between growth stocks and tech stocks and it is also the case that the broad market is heavily represented by large cap tech stocks and so some of the volatility the swings that we're seeing in the market right now and the declines that some major companies have faced in the past few weeks much of that reflects investors repricing these stocks and reassessing what they're willing to pay for the prospect of future returns in light of the high inflationary environment that we're currently in so stocks and real estate historically are great hedges against inflation but not all stocks are created equal and there will be in the short term volatility in the markets as investors reassess what they believe companies are worth in light of inflation expectations and by the way i don't mean to constantly be banging the pro real estate drum but if you've spent the last couple of years sitting on the sidelines considering possibly investing in real estate the draw of locking in a fixed rate mortgage and buying a tangible asset that historically is a low volatility inflation hedge that tangible asset of course being real estate that draw the inflation protection that real estate can provide is particularly appealing at this point in time we know that inflation is not transitory it's here to stay and the current economic environment really highlights the usefulness of holding a tangible asset like real estate that provides a stable long term inflation hedge if you want to learn more about real estate go to affordance dot com slash vip list that's afford anything dot com slash vip list we'll email you a ton of information about real estate it's totally free lots of valuable information contained there around how to approach this asset class afford anything dot com slash vip list so let's recap what we've talked about in part one we defined what is inflation we discussed the causes of inflation and we related this to everything that's transpired in the last two years in part two we discussed the effects of inflation we talked about how some degree of inflation is desirable a target of around two percent for a developed nation like the us and that even in the best of times inflation needs to be managed carefully because anytime you inject liquidity into a financial system the effect is not felt equally we discussed the cantillin effect which describes the concept of relative inflation which means there's a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy that takes place at different times and the closer a person or entity is to the source of that liquidity the faster they're likely to be to access that money and therefore generate wealth so the cantillon effect describes how the new money supply has localized effects we talked about how inflation is bad for some people and good for others for example it's bad for savers and good for borrowers bad for importers good for exporters we talked about the difference between tangible assets versus paper assets and we described growth versus value stocks part three of this five part deep dive understanding inflation at a conceptual level remember as we discussed in part two inflation doesn't happen universally across all sectors of the economy at the same time and so in order to measure inflation we have to track a diversified basket of goods and services there are two such baskets that are used in the u s one is the cpi the other is the ppi the cpi the consumer price index is a weighted basket of consumer needs so it represents things like transportation food medical care the types of necessities and consumer staples that individuals and households have to buy which is another way of saying the cpi measures or at least attempts to measure cost of living so when the cpi is calculated retail prices are tracked meaning they're not looking at production costs they're not looking at wholesale costs they're looking purely at what you or i would pay for an item on the open market and then those changes in price are weighted in proportion to the significance of that good or service when it comes to household spending so all these retail prices are being tracked in accordance with their relative weight within this basket but here's the thing sometimes there are items in this basket that change in price for reasons that don't have anything to do with inflation and sometimes those items constitute such a big chunk of household spending that including those items in there can really throw the numbers off specifically i'm talking about food and fuel sometimes food prices go up because there was a hurricane or there's some sort of e coli outbreak or as happened recently a safety inspector got a credible death threat and now we have a shortage of avocados coming in from mexico which is causing the price of guacamole to go up these types of events particularly natural disasters weather events these can temporarily impact the price of food or the price of certain types of food but it doesn't reflect anything related to inflation and similarly the cost of fuel oil and gas that can be impacted by a whole bunch of factors including political factors that don't necessarily reflect inflation so both of those sectors food and fuel are pretty volatile if those two sectors move that can have an outsized impact on cpi even though it doesn't actually reflect inflationary pressures and so there's a measure a different measure referred to as core inflation and core inflation is the measure of cpi minus food and fuel core inflation looks at price changes across that same diversified basket of services goods and services except for food and energy in order to mitigate the impact of these volatile sectors is it a better way to measure inflation that's a subject of debate but certainly it provides another data point that can round out the picture and another data point that can round out the picture is what's known as the ppi the producer price index and this measures the average weighted price changes that sellers receive for intermediate goods to state it simply the cpi is looking at inflation from the perspective of retail buyers you and me the ppi is looking at inflation from the perspective of sellers and producers if you go to the bureau of labor statistics website you'll see that the ppi publishes more than commodity price indexes for goods and for seasonally adjusted services so they're tracking a lot of the price changes that are happening upstream and that offers another layer of insight that can round out the way that we monitor and measure inflation now we don't hear about ppi as much on the news typically we'll hear some headline related to the cpi and often the discussion is really around two things number one how much has it gone up but number two how fast is it continuing to go up have we hit an apex after which the rate of increase will slow or are we a boulder rolling down a hill with lots of momentum and no sign of stopping anytime you're monitoring any metric or any change you're looking not just at the month over month numbers but also at the increase or decrease within those numbers over time and again this episode is not here to predict the future this episode is here to have a stronger understanding of the present and so to that end bear in mind that whenever you see a headline about cpi look not just at the most recent reported change but also at how that change compares contextually to the rate at which it's been changing and that wraps up part three our discussion on how inflation is measured leading us to part four let's talk about some historic examples how has inflation played out in the past we'll start in the s with the german weimar republic germany financed world war one by borrowing heavily and printing huge amounts of unbacked currency fiat currency and the reason i'm taking the time to note that it was unbacked was because prior to world war one germany's currency was backed by gold germany got rid of this gold standard in and at the time the german mark the french franc the italian lira and the british shilling all had roughly equal value and roughly comparable dollar exchange rates us dollar exchange rates so that was the situation in but then from to prices of everything in germany doubled as germany both borrowed a lot of money and printed a lot of money to be able to pay for the war world war one ended in and under the treaty of versailles it was required to make reparations payments in gold backed marks this created a degree of financial stress and remember how we mentioned that prices doubled between and well they doubled again between and and so by many citizens were starting to get rid of their paper assets get rid of their currency and convert it into tangible assets pianos diamonds pieces of art real estate people began piling into tangible goods because prices had doubled twice in the last eight years but despite this people were more worried about unemployment than they were about inflation the chief objective was to keep the population working and germany saw that given the devaluation of the mark they were well poised to be able to export many of their goods so they just kept printing money they kept printing money in order to facilitate exports and keep the population employed and what happened next was it spiraled out of control in one u s dollar was worth about four or five german marks by november one us dollar was equal to one trillion marks so at that point the currency straight up lost all meaning and ordinary citizens were bartering goods with one another they were that into tangible assets that by people were trading a handkerchief for some carrots or a shirt for some shoes people were also especially pre when it really went to rail back in before it spiraled out of control people were also aggressively investing in foreign currencies trading german marks for a litany of currencies from many other nations as a side note i will make the connection that cryptocurrencies which are non fiat currencies grew in popularity during the pandemic and as i've said many times before on this podcast when we talk about quote unquote investing in crypto what we're really talking about is a form of currency exchange in which you exchange one medium of exchange the us dollar for a different medium of exchange such as bitcoin or ethereum or stellar lumens now i'm not stating that the us is going to be the weimar republic absolutely not but i do think there's a notable parallel that when a population anticipates inflation one of the things that ordinary individuals do is they start converting their money into other forms of currency and it happens that we currently live in an age where currency can be digital and programming language can be written such that the issuance of new supply of that digital currency into circulation is governed by an algorithm rather than by politicians again i am not comparing the us to the weimar republic in any way whatsoever please don't think i'm doing that and and what i'm largely speaking to is the reframing of cryptocurrency not as an investment but as an alternate currency at any rate this is a history lesson so we won't go down the crypto rabbit hole but that is the cautionary tale of the weimar republic and it's a tale of hyperinflation and while it's easy to say well that was the s that happened in literally a century ago and that was a very different time there was a war in europe there was a different pandemic the spanish flu pandemic of and that was a much deadlier pandemic one third of the world's population ended up infected by the virus and about million people worldwide died in that pandemic so they were dealing with a lot back then nothing that we could ever relate to so why spend all this time talking about something that happened a century ago why live in the past and if that's what you're thinking all right fair enough let's talk about zimbabwe zimbabwe was the first nation to experience hyperinflation in the st century in as the rest of the world was undergoing the great recession zimbabwe's inflation rate topped per month and it got worse from there by november prices were doubling on average every hours but i don't want to sound alarmist or i don't want to sound as though i'm telling you about these historic examples in order to create an alarmist narrative because the reality is nothing like that has ever happened in the united states in when zimbabwe was experiencing hyperinflation we in the u s were experiencing what's known as biflation biflation is an example of the cantillon effect and it happens when there's strong demand for certain types of assets and weak demand for others causing prices in one sector of the economy to rise and prices in other sectors to fall which means that we simultaneously experience both inflation and deflation at the same time that's biflation that's what happened in the u s during the great recession of given the severity of the recession and given the amount of money that was pumped into the economy in order to get us out of that recession it is truly uplifting and very fortuitous that inflation fears that some of us held during that time did not come to pass we ended that recession and launched into a decade of prosperity with a low inflation rate an year bull run and an unprecedented flourishing of digital innovation that took place over the last decade and so fortunately our most recent example of inflation or specifically biflation fortunately is not a cautionary tale it did not spiral out of control in fact the worst that the u s has experienced was a two decade period from the mid s"", ""music in this video we're talking all about inflation and how traders can use the inflation studies that we're about to discuss to improve their trading dramatically fundamentals are not something that most retail traders use but they are incredibly powerful and most hedge fund managers big traders professionals incorporate some level of fundamentals in their trading in fact most hedge funds rely more on fundamentals than they do on technicals so if the pros are doing that we as regular traders here on uh you know out in the streets we should try and incorporate some level of fundamentals as well so in this video we're going to talk all about inflation and i'm going to explain it to you in the simplest way i can so that you don't have to go to four years of of economics to you know college in order to understand the stuff i'm going to try and keep it relatively relatively simple and keep it relevant to a trader we're not just going to talk economics we're going to talk about how you you as a trader can tangibly use this information that is so often talked about on tv youtube you know all sorts of financial outlets they're talking about inflation constantly so let's get into it inflation explained and notably how to profit from it how can we actually take advantage of understanding the inflation readings and where they may be going next well first of all we need to know what inflation is and to understand that why traders should care we have to understand kind of what implications the inflation readings of the world have on real world everyday stuff as well as financial markets so inflation is in its simplest form it's the rise in the price of goods and services it actually can be the rise or the fall of price and goods it's like when you go to the store one day and something costs to i don't know ten dollars and the next hit costs you that change in price may not seem like a lot but it is incredibly impactful to the global economy to the local economy to the consumer and all sorts of levels and this has a massive impact on the financial market because inflation can be you know how many of us have gone to the gas pumps and it's suddenly very very expensive and that hurts your pockets right that impact is massive on financial markets and again we're going to explain it and understand how to benefit from it in this video so it is basically the rise in prices of goods and services i'm talking anything from getting your car filled up with fuel to buying something at the grocery store to renting an apartment all of these things are of course they have goods and services that are priced in a certain way and watching those prices is powerful so another way of thinking about inflation is it's actually the loss of fiat purchasing power so if the price of stuff is going up what's actually really happening is the value of your dollar or euro or canadian dollar or whatever you're using your pound whatever you're using you if prices are going up around you it's not just prices going up what it's really doing is it's really the power of your currency is going down it's losing value and if you looked at any long term chart maybe we can show something on the screen right now this is the purchasing power of the united states dollar over time and you can see it loses one of the worst long term investments you can own is just holding cash under a mattress you know like all those uh you know people who would who would hide their cash into the mattress and think that they're safe well you can't hide from inflation none of us can it's a really powerful force that is pretty persistent in financial markets the last couple hundred years actually for longer than that even back to the roman times there were periods of elevated inflation anyways that's another history lesson wrong channel for that let's get into of course the uh the concepts here so you can see this this red line here is the price of goods and services and of course the blue line is the fiat purchasing power and again these things usually move in the opposite direction your currency usually over time becomes value less and again we have to be aware of that but also it has hit big impacts on finance digital markets so why should traders care so why does this matter to you and i if we're trading each and every day especially if you're a day trader this doesn't matter to you at all right wrong day traders have a fallacy of thinking that you know economic figures don't impact them but they certainly can create some very strong trends in the market and knowing what those trends involve and what they entail from the inflation figures can be very powerful so let's talk about this so tr the reason traders should care is because these central banks care the federal reserve here in the united states the bank of canada and canada the bank of england in the uk the ecb or the european central bank these places watch inflation really really carefully because it can make or break an economy and so central banks have a very strong interest in keeping inflation at or near two percent per year that is the western financial thought process that basically around a two percent inflation level is ideal that is a level it will get into why that's so ideal in just a moment but it's a healthy pace of inflation it's not too hot it's not too low and we'll talk about that in just a moment but what you have to understand is that as a trader the simplest way to understand it is that why should you care the most powerful financial entities in the world that move markets the most they care tremendously about this topic so to the actions of central banks this this is a really important part here the actions the central banks may take to accomplish this agenda of keeping inflation at a at or around two percent per year uh really moves the markets because what they may do to to uh stop or or uh you know cool or raise inflation is all about the interest rates they can rise interest rates or or let interest rates go down cut rates or hike rates and this has a massive impact on the financial market we'll talk about that in just a moment so first of all we need to talk about how can we as you know regular people how can we view what inflation is actually looking like well we have what is called the cpi this is the consumer price index and if you've never heard of this the consumer price index is basically a way to track the changes in prices of goods and services over time now the cpi is basically i like to think of it as like a basket of different things picture like a basket with a bunch of item items in it like you have like a coca cola can and a mcdonald's you know mcflurry in there i don't know just like a bunch of random things and if we were to track these prices over time within this basket we could check the price of the overall basket over time we could get an idea of what uh broadly speaking prices are doing in the united states or if we're studying this basket in canada or the uk we can study their respective cpi basket as well so cpi has several components i've drawn a little wheel here and all this is just representing here is what actually makes up the basket of cpi stuff now each one of these are kind of a basket in their own so it's like baskets within a basket kind of thing but basically understand that cpi components at its simplest form involve things like food and beverages uh energy which is like of course like gasoline and things like that housing which is anything from apartments to home purchases transportation medical care recreation and other so the reason i point this out to you is that within the cpi lots of different things can impact what the cpi actually turns out to be and the number one thing or another thing you need to know about this is that in red you can see this is the most volatile stuff the most volatile stuff is definitely going to be your food and energy what do i mean by that well these prices fluctuate the most energy if you watch the oil markets going up and down all the time and the price that we pay at the pumps is pretty constantly changing and this has a lot of impact and can very much sway what the cpi is looking like so some uh some some traders prefer to actually look at the core cpi now the core cpi removes a couple of those very volatile things and looks at some of the more staple goods to get a more reliable look at what prices are really doing so most volatile gets actually removed you can see they're crossed out so we remove food and energy from the equation to get a better look at what inflation is looking like um now again cpi is a way to measure inflation the reason you need to understand this is because this is how we're going this is what we're going to consult in order to make trading decisions so now that we know what the inflation reading the cpi the consumer price index what that actually is and why it matters we can now talk about with those measurements what do we do with them well we have to understand what these measurements can kind of tell us about the economy and where things are headed so here's the thing when we take a look at inflation in terms of a position what's the positioning of inflation right now i've broken it down to three broadly speaking categories of inflation that i pay attention to the first one here is when cpi is percent remember the ideal spot was two percent that's again in terms of like what the bank of canada and the bank of england and what the fed they generally speaking they want two percent inflation per year so if things are lower than that if we're seeing for example cpi under percent or less i like to call this area disinflation this is not a perfect number by the way this is just my educated guess under or at percent we're going to call that kind of disinflation and this is actually not good now again remember why two percent why not zero percent well too little inflation is actually tough because um you know i'll show you this this this we're going to jump down to this section here for a second low inflation shows economic recession potentially and a lack of demand and growth because think about it if prices are not being bid up by consumers consistently that shows that there's a lack of demand maybe people aren't buying you know items at the store they're they're saving their money or people aren't renting apartments and bidding up rents obviously that sounds like you know that might be a good thing for you and i and of course you know in some ways it would be but for the economy not so much because that lack of spending and lack of money movement is not so great for an economy again we don't want too much of that either because too much inflation i've marked it as percent or more in terms of the cpi uh that is what we call hot inflation and in we experienced that quite a bit inflation remained very elevated and in the u s went up to like nine percent now nine percent is far away from two percent and there was some serious concerns around that so high inflation uh it can lead to runaway prices which can hurt the economy quite a bit as you can probably imagine runaway prices are no fun for any of us if you're thinking about trying to get a new house or buying a new car anybody trying to get a car during it was a nightmare the the prices of used cars and new cars they were flying high because consumers were bidding up those prices now sometimes it can actually be like in the case of we had supply line issues due to the russia invasion invasion of ukraine we saw a lot of supply line issues across the board same thing with kova these things cause inflation because a lack of supply creates a huge amount of demand and everybody rushes for products bidding them up to the heavens it's not fun for consumers and what it actually can do is it actually can lead to an overheating of the economy people are rushing product prices so high that the consumer gets squashed and they can't afford anything and maybe some of you guys might say that sounds a little bit like the united states today and other places of course like you know the uk is experiencing this as well many places are it can be very devastating and this is why the fed wants that inflation not to go too high the last thing they want is to overheat the economy and kill the consumer to the point that there's a massive recession that follows this has happened in the past in the united states uh you know go take a look at some of the times in the previous uh you know decades where we saw very elevated levels of inflation and it led to some really tough years afterwards so will that happen here in the united states right now many people would speculate that that could be the case and that's why in the last few years uh with all this inflation people now have like a slight chance of a recession uh here in the united states that could be pretty devastating due to all the the prices running up so much like they have so the point is high inflation not so good really low inflation not so good sweet spot inflation which i've marked here on this as to inflation is comfortably within the realm of what the fed kind of wants it's not perfect is pretty high still low but i like to call this just generally speaking pretty close to where things have have you know uh kind of gotten back to where the fed wants them during this time here in has been incredibly bullish year for stocks and i'm i'm going to break this down here what each one of these categories tells us about financial markets because this is the part that is really key if you know how markets generally behave in each one of these categories you can use that to your massive advantage which is something that i use in my own trading so we'll get into that next so again remember that the fed's goal is to keep moderate inflation with max employment so how do they do that well here's what they do okay so in this category here the disinflation period what the federal reserve has as its tool is interest rates now i'm talking federal reserve for the us dollar example if you're in the bank of england territory you're talking about uk that's a different story we're just talking here as an example in the u s uh example okay so for the federal reserve if they see cpi is you know very low what will they do well they might choose to cut interest rates making borrowing more accessible to businesses and to consumers who may want to go out and buy a car or buy a house so in this case fed may cut rates okay in this case that has some implications on the market we'll talk about that in just a second in the middle spot sweet spot the fed is pretty content they may in this case fed may hold they might just be good to keep interest rates at that level again they raise interest rates to slow the economy down they cut interest rates to speed the economy up this is their measurement this is again western philosophy of how financial markets can work uh and then next let's talk about the last one which is of course high levels of inflation the fed may hike interest rates okay so this is what we saw if you're watching this video relatively recently to when i want to record this in and we've sent a lot of rate hikes because inflation has been on the upper limits of this it's been very hot inflation in the last year and a half well the fed does what they raise rates to try and keep things under control next up we've got to talk about how to trade it and this is really key because in the case of using this information there's three different categories that i've broken down and three different ways to look at them in a disinflation environment where things are really slow this in my opinion and and studying traditionally kind of market sentiment this is generally speaking in a really low period this is a scary time this is recession this is fear in the world this is uncertainty if central banks and economies will be able to survive all that good stuff not so good it's like this is terrible right it's a really really tough time the this generally speaking can be a really positive scenario for gold and silver as people may be very very fearful of what's going to happen and move out of the dollar move out of stocks and go into something good old fashioned like gold and silver this is also a time where maybe other currencies like the japanese yen or other stronger currencies out there may look more attractive relative to our us dollar example here so again uh it's bullish for gold for silver other currencies that look stronger and healthier and finally also bonds bonds typically do well during recession as people may um you know think that rate cuts are coming and again bonds trade heavily based on what interest rates are going to do and so as we'll speak about probably in a future video about interest rates this is a really important thing by the way if you're enjoying the video do me a quick favor hit that thumbs up button and subscribe if you're new we have more videos like this coming these are a lot of work to put together so if you do enjoy these types of videos again help us out hit that thumbs up button for the algorithm okay finally we also have bearish stuff in a disinflationary environment where inflation is very low or possibly shrinking stocks and indices don't look great because again this is showing that the demand in the economy is really low and low demand is probably not going to do well for companies who are really struggling finally we also have the us dollar down or bearish because people are probably not going to be too confident in the us dollar when the economy is totally slowing up and again bond prices are going up yields are going down people are very concerned think about it this way dollar not so good in a disinflationary environment so something to think about there the next category is talking about the sweet spot when inflation is at what the federal reserve probably deems a pretty healthy zone or at least close to that two percent target this environment is totally different than the first one and the last one in this case we're actually in my opinion this is where you want to be very bullish stocks and indices and equities and things like that like this is the period where if things look confident things look okay the fed's not going to raise interest rates on you and you're economy looks pretty strong all of these things great time to buy stocks and indices personally one of my favorite styles and timings to trade stocks and indices is in the sweet spot environment in fact we briefly have kind of come back closer to that area since 's mayhem and it's been a really great year for me in trading primarily stocks and indices uh you know during kind of coming back into a little bit more of a sweet spot will it stay there we'll see again things are still developing every day but anyways the next thing is of course during this period of time we also see uh non usd currencies doing well because again this is kind of an optimistic time and foreign investment might be elevated and other currencies might do pretty well because in this spot the what drives the us dollar higher is a lot of times it's rising interest rates and a red hot economy so in this case the us dollar is not really necessarily like full on bearish but it's definitely not full on bullish so i'd say it's closer to bearish during this category and so is gold because gold typically does well in fearful environments or in highly inflationary environments so both of those situations are not the case here in the sweet spot because during the sweet spot we're seeing things uh kind of normalized and doing very well overall and gold typically doesn't do well in confident market environments usually uh that's that's there's a little there should be a little asterisk next to that because it's not perfect science with any of this stuff there's other factors than just inflation for sure this is just kind of a lens of inflation to consider in your toolbox finally hot inflation hot inflation is pretty much just bullish for the us dollar if you take a look at the year the dollar just screamed higher all year long and it was because interest rates were going up and up and up because inflation was going up and up and up and the fed was trying to combat that rise in inflation by raising the interest rates in the united states so the point is us dollar typically does very good during that time on the bearish side pretty much everything stocks don't look so great like they didn't look great in non usd currencies like the euro the pound everything against the dollar typically will fall in a very hot inflation area where the fed is is you know on the door knocking and raising rates those things are going to put a lot of pressure on the dollar to the upside and of course that means other currencies may do less well and finally bonds typically don't do well because rising interest rates make current bonds or old bonds previously issued bonds less attractive to investors because why buy a bond at two percent when it looks like interest rates are going to go up to three percent i might just wait and buy a bond once interest rates get much higher so that's why bonds can be a very important market as well we've probably got another video coming on bonds lots of stuff here so make sure to subscribe if you have not already okay guys so i wanted to show you something on the edge finder which is our team's market data software where we can take a look at some inflation figures and what you'll notice is that there's all sorts of different major economies and their respective inflation here reported and if you take a look at the blue line that's going to be our us dollar uh related inflation so of course when it comes to inflation we've been we saw a very high spike in inflation during and in we saw a decline in inflation well one thing when it comes to scoring and adding in inflation to my trading strategy is i want to take into account what is going on with particular currencies in our top setups algorithm so if you're not familiar with the edge finder what this tool does is it takes into account tons of different market data specifically to this video talking about inflation the edge finder automatically pulls in the latest inflation statistics and then what it does is it actually scores and ranks all the different assets on the far left so one thing that we often hear from people who are using our tools are you know they want to use fundamentals in their trading like you know growth and inflation and unemployment and interest rates and use all that information to better their trading but it's a lot of work to keep up with and to check all this stuff so the edge finder does a pretty cool thing it takes into account all of this data and it pretty much ranks and files things for you so every everything that we're talking about in this video is pretty much accounted for the way i explained it is accounted for in the edge finder where it takes into account inflation as well as many other key metrics scores the totals and gives us biases so one thing that you'll notice here is that when we're looking at the euro versus the dollar the pound versus the dollar what we're seeing is recently the inflation in the united states has spiked back up again pointing towards a bullish reading on the dollar now remember as we've gone in this video so far uh talking about inflation rising is bullish for the currency because the central bank may be more likely to act and so we're getting certain readings and part of that waiting is coming directly from our inflation study that we're talking about so you can directly see how the lessons that we're discussing in this video are in in fact certainly being reflected in the scoring algorithm from the edge finder which is for me personally where i find the trades that i am taking so inflation as well as other things are playing a serious waiting into which trades i am actually looking to take on what particular assets for example right now at the time of recording this we know inflation is ticking up well that inflation reading uh is pointing towards a slightly more bearish reading for gold as the dollar may become more attractive and put downward pressure on the gold market if you'd like access to the edge finder again you can find more information down below in the description so now that you guys have seen a little bit of our software tool that we use to calculate and monitor inflation automatically i want to tell you about how you can get access to it the link will be down below in the description if you'd like to chat with someone on our team you can have a direct message conversation to see if this tool would be a fit for you it is a high level tool that our team has put together over time we're a software company

1,9,1_inflation_price_measure_cpi,"['inflation', 'price', 'measure', 'cpi', 'also', 'good', 'cost', 'increase', 'consumer', 'rate', 'basket', 'index']","[""you've probably noticed that when you see inflation data in the economic calendar or when you read the financial news they'll often refer to headline inflation and core inflation so what's the difference well as you know the way that inflation measures are usually explained is by referring to a basket of goods and services essentially you're measuring the price change over time of that basket of items and if the price of that basket of goods and services goes up that's inflation so headline inflation looks at a price of everything in that basket so it's the whole basket of goods and services whereas core inflation looks at the price of the basket after removing items that have more volatile prices like energy and food so it's the whole basket excluding certain items now policy makers like those guys at the central bank will usually focus more on headline inflation james butler's a policy maker at the federal reserve has previously mentioned that they prefer headline inflation because it includes everything a household is purchasing people don't generally have the options to just exclude food or fuel from their expenses although it would be pretty good if you could but that doesn't mean that core inflation is useless in fact it can give us a much better picture of what's going on overall in the economy so let's look at two broad scenarios so i can help you to understand this in scenario one headline inflation is significantly higher than core inflation if this is the case it could signal that prices are being driven by the volatile items like energy and food now since their prices can fluctuate up and down a lot more often inflation in those areas tends to fall more into the temporary category or that infamous term transitory and this would be known as cost push inflation where higher prices are being caused by something on the supply side now monetary policy isn't really well suited for fixing supply problems and so from a central bank's point of view there's probably not much point in slowing the economy down too much if they can't actually address the core issue it may also be the case that they forecast prices will fall in the medium to long term so they're willing to accept some above target inflation in the short term while they wait for that to happen now this doesn't mean that they won't take action but it just might come in the form of a slower pace of interest rate rises or something like that however if inflation runs too high for too long the central bank will probably begin to take much bigger action and that brings us on to scenario two so in this scenario headline inflation and core inflation are both running relatively high this could signal that inflation is more broad throughout the whole economy and there's too much demand for goods and services relative to the the lower supply it could even come as a result of inflation from other areas spilling over into the broader economy things like energy prices so energy inflation can affect everything in the economy it's not just about the energy that you buy as a consumer being more expensive but also situations like retailers passing on their cost increases can consumers in the form of higher prices so this can sort of broadly push up the prices of things throughout the whole economy and therefore as a result workers are going to start demanding higher wages and again that's going to push up demand even more and it could lead to a situation where we have a wage price spiral which could cause inflation to continue to rise so you can see how the different aspects are interconnected throughout the economy and how inflation in one area can cause a knock on effect so in this sort of situation inflation would be considered to be much more persistent and the central bank would likely be tightening their policy to try and get it back under control so that would typically mean raising interest rates and slowing economic growth now we've only looked at two broad scenarios there and there could be many other factors to consider like the labor market and so on but you can already begin to see how headline and core inflation can be used together to build a better picture of what's happening in the economy and to anticipate the sort of actions a central bank may take in the future and if you want to understand more about inflation including how it affects the markets for traders and investors there are other videos on screen now hit the thumbs up button if you found this helpful thanks for watching"", ""hey everyone with all the talk of inflation in the news i thought it would be prudent to do a quick video on a common measure of inflation namely the consumer price index or cpi but first what is inflation inflation is where the general prices of goods and services increase deflation on the other hand is when they decreased for instance due to inflation the price of a loaf of bread in the uk in was p in it is around as prices rise this means that the currency's purchasing power decreases using the same example p nowadays could buy you six and a half loaves of bread back in whereas now it can only get you one so why does this happen well it happens because the price of raw materials production and salaries to make and sell that loaf of bread rise over time inflation can also happen as the demand for certain goods rise more demand than supply means an increase in the price of supply now people politicians economics need a way to quantify and measure this rate of inflation and as such have developed ways to do this so let's talk about cpi one of the common measures cpi is a theoretical basket of everyday goods each with an average price tag now there are hundreds of everyday goods and services that are tracked and they are split into eight categories namely housing clothing transport food and drink medical care recreation education and other examples within these categories might include the price of a carton of milk a loaf of bread rent a pair of shoes electricity and so on these also depend what country you are from the basket of goods in the uk will be different from the basket of goods in the us and this basket is also dependent on the times in which we live for example in hand sanitizer was added to this list cpi is always measured against a base year so if the average cost of a basket in is pound and the average cost of that same basket in is pound ten the increase is five pound twenty divided by five pound ten times a hundred which is one point zero one nine or simply one one point nine percent rise cpi helps determine the purchasing power of a currency and consequently the rate of inflation the government here in the uk aims to keep inflation at the two percent level the general view is that if inflation is too high or changes a lot it's hard for businesses to set the right prices for their products and for people to plan their spending on the other hand if it is too low then people might not spend as much as they expect prices to fall which stops the economy from growing having said that the reason why everyone is talking about it now is that inflation in the uk is now as high as percent now when we talk in terms of loaves of bread it's hard to see how a five percent rise in prices is impactful in the everyday however it really is and is something everyone needs to take seriously let's take a broad example say in you receive a net salary of pounds a year and your cost of living bills rent car etc comes to around twenty thousand pounds a year so you manage to put ten thousand pounds away in savings on a five percent inflation rate your cost of living in one year's time in will essentially be pounds now if your salary doesn't go up accordingly to match inflation then now you're only saving pounds a year and this goes on and on so why is inflation so high at the moment well there are a number of reasons but it's mostly due to the global pandemic energy price increases and the varying supply supply chain disruption leading to less supply than demand as a whole which puts upward pressure on the prices so what has the government done well in order to try and lessen the effects of inflation two days ago the bank of england decided to raise interest rates to from its all time low of percent so what does this do generally interest rates and inflation rates have an inverse relationship if interest rates are low more people can borrow money to spend the economy grows and inflation increases if interest rates are high people tend to save more because returns from savings are greater this means they don't spend as much the economy slows and inflation decreases so a higher interest rate basically is trying to decrease the demand of the demand supply relationship which we spoke about before i hope that makes sense it is important to note that cpi is not the only measure of inflation in the uk we also have an adjustment cpi known as cpih which includes home occupies housing costs this means the theoretical basket includes all the costs associated with owning maintaining and living in one's own home there is also an older measure of inflation called the retail price index as as well as the wholesale price index but i'll perhaps go into those in other videos i hope this gives you a starting overview of cpi inflation and interest rates if you enjoyed this video please do subscribe to my channel and comment below if you have any thoughts take care everyone i'll see you all soon music"", ""welcome back to kano academy today we'll be covering the subject of economics by discussing inflation in today's video we'll focus on what is inflation as well as the different types of inflation and the causes of inflation including some of the consequences of inflation as well as several measures to combat inflation please watch until the end of the video because we'll also provide you with some valuable tips to help you ace your assignments tests and exams so let's get started as an introduction let us define what we mean by the term inflation inflation refers to a sustained and significant increase in the general price level over a period of time and at the same time a decline in the buying power of money there are different types of inflation in this next section we will look at the following four type types which are consumer inflation producer inflation and all inclusive inflation and hyperinflation let's briefly discuss each of these types starting with consumer inflation this is also known as cpi which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services that are typically purchased by consumers this includes things like food clothing transportation and housing producer inflation is another type of inflation this is also known as ppi this measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services that are typically purchased by businesses this includes things like raw materials intermediate goods and energy another type of inflation is known as an all inclusive inflation all inclusive inflation measures the rate of change in prices of all goods and services for both consumer and produce sir this is a broader measure of inflation than cpi or ppi the last type of inflation we will look at is hyperinflation hyperinflation is a very high rate of inflation typically defined as an annual inflation rate of or more hyperinflation can be very disruptive to an economy as it can lead to a loss of faith in the currency and a collapse of the economy inflation can be caused by various factors in this next section we will discuss these two factors starting with demand pull inflation this occurs when there is excessive demand for goods and services relative to the available supply when demand outpaces supply prices tend to rise another cause of inflation can be cost push inflation this happens when the cost of production increases leading to higher prices factors such as rising wages increased raw material costs or higher taxes can contribute to cost push inflation there are numerous consequences of inflation in this next section we will discuss how inflation affects the following starting with debtors and creditors debtors benefit because they receive money with a high purchasing power and repay their debt with money with low purchasing power creditors on the other hand may suffer due to inflation inflation also impacts on wage and salary earners people with a fixed income will be able to purchase less as prices are rising another consequence of inflation can be felt by investors and savers assets with a fixed nominal value have a fixed return and lower purchasing power as prices increase furthermore real value of savings also decreases inflation also affects taxpayers in south africa income is taxed on a progressive system therefore inflation causes what is termed as a bracket creep this is when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets or reduces the value of credits deductions and exemptions bracket creep essentially results in an increase in income taxes without an increase in real income lastly another consequence of inflation is the disruption of industrial peace which is often caused by wage bargaining and usually accompanied by strikes and mass action there are a number of measures that the government and policy makers can use to fight inflation when it gets too high in this next section we highlight three types of policy measures to be used to combat inflation let's start with fiscal measures these are specific measures taken by the government and particularly the minister of finance regarding taxation and expenditure these measures can include the following an increase in direct taxation such as personal income tax which will help to decrease demand an increase in indirect taxation such as vat which will lead to a decrease in spending because goods become more expensive a loan levy which will ultimately reduce disposable income of consumers the state could consider cutting back on expenditure by canceling government projects like roads hospitals and schools the state could also impose surcharges on imported goods this will increase the price of these imported goods resulting in many people being unable to afford to buy these goods the country's reserve bank and the government can also apply certain monetary measures to curb inflation including the following the reserve bank can adjust the quantity of money to meet the needs of the economy through eg open market policy thus maintaining a fine balance the reserve bank can also curb inflation caused by excess demand by reducing the money supply the reserve bank can also apply moral pressure on financial institutions to be more careful when granting credit the repo rate is another tool used by central banks to manage monetary policy and influence economic conditions while the repo rate is primarily used to control borrowing costs and stimulate or restrict economic activity it can indirectly impact savings as well when the central bank increases the repo rate it often leads to higher interest rates offered by commercial banks on savings accounts and fixed deposits this can make saving more attractive as individuals can earn higher returns on their savings the prospect of earning a better interest rate can therefore encourage people to save more additional measures that can be taken to combat inflation include the following increase productivity this is a long term measure generated through improved education and training which allows more people to be employed and ensures they are more productive price control by fixing the price of certain essential goods the government assures they remain affordable wage policy the government can also take a decision to break the inflationary spiral of increased wages and prices by keeping the increase in wages below or at the level of inflation stricter conditions for consumer credit the government can also make it harder for consumers to get credit in order to restrict their spending encourage personal savings as indicated previously the government can implement measures to encourage savings for example by cutting taxes on savings the imbalance between demand and supply is corrected by increased savings as people save more and spend less relaxed import controls the government and policy makers may also consider relaxing import control measures through tariff reductions removal of import quotas easing import restrictions and entering into free trade agreements another measure to combat inflation is by using floating exchange rate this is when prices are automatically adjusted to international conditions indexation this is a policy of linking prices of items such as wages pensions and mortgage bond interest rates to price indices in order to eliminate the effects of inflation before we continue as promised here are five quick study tips starting with number five start studying early don't wait until the night before the exam to start studying give yourself plenty of time to learn the material so that you can absorb it properly number four create data study schedule and stick to it break down the material into manageable chunks and schedule time to study each day this will help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed number three find a study method that works for you some people prefer to read their textbooks while others prefer to take notes or watch videos experiment with different methods until you find one that helps you learn the material effectively number two take breaks studying for long periods of time can be counterproductive get up and move around every to minutes to avoid getting burned out and very important number one get a good night's sleep before the exam this will help you be alert and focused on exam day now back to today's topic just to recap on what we covered in this video inflation refers to a sustained and significant increase in the general price level over a period of time this means that on average the prices of goods and services are rising while the purchasing power of a unit of currency is decreasing there are also different types of inflation in this video we looked at the following four types which are consumer inflation producer inflation all inclusive inflation as well as hyperinflation we also learned the various factors that cause inflation including demand pull inflation and cost push inflation we also covered a number of consequences as a result of inflation and also learned that there are a number of measures that can be taken to combat inflation including fiscal and monetary policy measures that the government and policy makers can use to fight inflation we also listed other measures to be considered to understand more on this topic please take time to re watch this video we hope we were able to provide more clarity on the topic of inflation if we have please let us know by leaving us a comment below this video we would love to know what you have learned on this topic you can also leave us a thumbs up to show your appreciation also make sure you like this video and take time to share and subscribe for more until we meet again happy learning from all of us at kano academy stay creative stay curious stay

the carter presidency inflation was increasing and unemployment was increasing at the same time we are kind of with a problem of inflation inflation is our friend everybody feels very poor there's a lot of people that just aren't making it it's a tough problem the question is how long will this go on the vocal rule today i'm going to talk about the cause of the great inflation of the s let's get started the great inflation was the defining macroeconomic event when the economy changed a lot it happened in the second half of the th century here and now declares unconditional war on poverty in america this period lasting from to caused economists to rethink the policies of the federal reserve and other central banks over the almost two decades it lasted there were four economic recessions two severe energy shortages and the unprecedented peacetime use of wage and price controls after the global monetary system created during world war ii was abandoned it was according to one prominent economist the greatest failure of american macroeconomic policy in the post war period that failure had a big impact on economic theory and the rules that control money policies at the federal reserve and other global central banks if the great inflation was a result of bad american economic policy then fixing it should be counted as a success now let's go into the forensics of the great inflation in inflation was about one percent each year it had been in this range for the previous six years inflation began to escalate in the mid s and reached more than percent in it eventually fell to three and a half percent in the latter half of the s while economists debate the relative importance of the factors that motivated and perpetuated inflation for more than a decade there is little debate about its source the great inflation was caused by too much money in the economy the federal reserve created this problem by promoting policies that encouraged too much growth in the money supply this episode of bad economic and monetary policy can be difficult to understand to make it easier to follow i will tell the story in three parts this is a forensic examination of the motive means and opportunity for the great inflation to occur the motive the phillips curve and the pursuit of full employment first just what is the phillips curve it's simply an economic concept stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship however the original concept has been disproven by what happened in the s when there was high inflation and unemployment at the same time the unemployment rate soared to percent nationwide last month the first portion of the story the motive underlying the great inflation dates back to the immediate aftermath of the great depression when macroeconomic theory and policy were similarly transformed after world war ii ended congress focused on creating policies that it hoped would promote economic stability the employment act of was one of the most important laws to come out of that time period among other things the act said that it is the responsibility of the federal government to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power and to make sure that there is better coordination between fiscal and monetary policies this act which is often regarded as the father of the federal reserve's modern dual mandate established the federal reserve's current two part mission to maintain long term growth and monetary and credit aggregates to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates after world war ii many countries followed a policy called keynesian stabilization this policy was motivated by the painful memory of high unemployment rates in the s at the consumer level america may not look much like an economy in distress but in shops and supermarkets in the residential suburbs inflation is now beginning to bypass the goal of these regulations was to control how much people spend known as demand by managing the government and central bank's spending and taxation policies as well as their monetary policies today the notion that monetary policy may and should be used to control aggregate spending and keep the economy on a stable track is still largely accepted but one critical and erroneous assumption to the implementation of the stabilization policy of the s and s was that there was a stable relationship between unemployment and inflation that could be exploited specifically it was generally believed that permanently lower rates of unemployment could be bought with modestly higher rates of inflation the idea that the phillips curve represented a longer term trade off between unemployment which was very harmful to economic well being and inflation which was sometimes perceived as an inconvenience appealed to policymakers who wanted to implement the employment act strictly however the stability of the philips curve was a dangerous assumption one that economists edmund phelps and milton friedman warned about said phelps if the statical optimum is chosen it is reasonable to suppose that the participants in product and labor markets will learn to expect inflation and that as a consequence of their rational anticipatory behavior the phillips curve will gradually shift upward to summarize if the fed wanted to pursue a policy of lower unemployment and more inflation while maintaining price stability it would be making a false bargain in which inflation must rise ever faster in order to keep up now for the means the collapse of bretton woods chasing the phillips curve in pursuit of lower unemployment could not have occurred if the policies of the federal reserve were well anchored and in the s the us dollar was anchored albeit very tenuously to gold through the bretton woods agreement so the story of the great inflation is in part also about the collapse of the bretton woods system and the separation of the u s dollar from its last link to gold during world war ii the world's industrial nations agreed to a global monetary system that they hope would bring greater economic stability and peace this system would promote global trade that system which was created by nations in bretton woods new hampshire in july provided for a fixed rate of exchange between the currencies of the world and the us dollar and the us dollar was linked to gold however the bretton woods system had a number of flaws in its implementation one of the biggest problems was that it tried to keep fixed parity between global currencies which was incompatible with the domestic economic goals of different countries as a consequence many nations were pursuing monetary policies that would move the phillips curve up and to the right in order to create a more favorable unemployment inflation link the united states status as the world's main currency has presented additional issues as global trade increased demand for u s dollar reserves increased as well for a time the demand for dollars was met by an expanding balance of payments deficit and foreign central banks amass more and more dollar reserves eventually the number of dollar reserves held abroad exceeded the u s stock of gold indicating that the united states could not maintain full convertibility at current gold prices a fact that would not go unnoticed by foreign governments and currency speculators as inflation increased during the latter part of the s people started to trade more us dollars for gold in the summer of president nixon stopped this exchange so that the u s dollar would not lose its value i have directed the secretary of the treasury to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets for the first time in history the dollar was just a piece of paper backed only by faith in the federal reserve and its policies your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today promise was only as good as the fed actions behind it but bowing to pressure from nixon and clinging to flawed economic theories the fed refused to raise rates music over the next decade the cost of living more than doubled the dollar lost more than half its value during the next two years there was an effort to salvage the global monetary system through the brief libs smithsonian agreement but the new arrangement fared no better than bretton woods and soon collapsed the post war global monetary system was finished the final link to gold cut most of the world's currencies were suddenly and completely unanchored this was the first time in history that most of the money in the world was on a paper money standard that could not be redeemed for anything valuable now for the opportunity fiscal imbalances energy shortages and bad data the late s and early s were difficult times for the u s economy inflation's built severe distortions into the economy on the industrial front it's the car manufacturers who've been hardest hit president johnson's great society legislation brought about major spending programs across a broad array of social initiatives at a time when the u s fiscal situation was already being strained by the vietnam war these growing fiscal imbalances make it more difficult to make monetary policy in order to avoid interfering the treasury's funding plans the federal reserve followed a policy of conducting even keel policies this meant the central bank would not alter its policy and would not adjust interest rates in the period between the announcement of a treasury issue and its sale to the market under normal circumstances treasury issues were rare and the fed's even keel policies had little influence on the implementation of monetary policy however as debt problems became more prevalent the fed's adherence to the ian keel principle began restricting monetary policy a more disruptive force was the repeated energy crises that increased oil costs and sapped u s growth the first crisis was an arab oil embargo that began in october and went on for about five months during this period crude oil prices quadrupled i've been in two gas lines already this morning this morning why doesn't anybody contact the president why is he letting this happen to us they reached a plateau that held until the iranian revolution brought a second energy crisis in the second crisis tripled the cost of oil in the s economists and policy makers began to understand that there were different types of inflation this was when they saw the increase in prices across all sectors demand and pole inflation was caused by government policies and specifically monetary policy it resulted from policies that produced a level of spending in excess of what the economy could produce without pushing the economy beyond its ordinary productive capacity and pulling more expensive resources into play but inflation could also be pushed higher by disruptions in the supply of food and energy this cost push inflation also got passed through the chain of production into higher retail prices from the viewpoint of the central bank the increasing cost of oil was largely out of its hands but the increase in unemployment that was occurring in response to the jump in oil prices was not the federal reserve responded to a mandate to establish full employment with little or no reserve management anchor by allowing huge and growing fiscal imbalances and fighting against the energy related headwinds these policies accelerated the amount of money in the economy and raised prices without reducing unemployment and arthur burns chairman of the fit he did not do what a good central banker should do and raise rates to break the inflation and by the time the s ended it was a total mess bad data or at least a bad understanding of the data also handicapped policymakers they've made decisions based on inaccurate information which resulted in them making poor choices looking back at the information policymakers had in hand during the period leading up to and during the great inflation economist athanasio's orphanites has shown that the real time estimate of potential output was significantly overstated and the estimate of the rate of unemployment consistent with full employment was significantly understated in other words policymakers were likely underestimating the inflationary effects of their policies in fact without increasing inflation the policy path there were almost simply untenable but wait there's more the phillips curve which was a crucial reference for federal reserve policy decisions began a shift and finally from high inflation to inflation targeting the conquest of u s inflation the stable trade off between inflation and unemployment turned out to be unstable as phelps and friedman correctly predicted the ability of policy makers to control any real variable was not permanent this truth included the rate of unemployment which oscillated around its natural rate the policy makers hoped to find a trade off but it did not exist as businesses and households came to appreciate indeed anticipate rising prices any trade off between inflation and unemployment became a less favorable exchange until in time unemployment became unacceptably high this became the era of stagflation in when this story began the inflation rate was one percent and the unemployment rate was five percent ten years later inflation would be more than percent and unemployment would be more than seven percent by the summer of inflation was approaching and a half percent and unemployment was over seven and a half percent federal reserve officials were not blind to the inflation that was occurring and were well aware of their two goals to achieve full employment and price stability the employment act of was recodified in by the full employment and balance growth act commonly known as the humphrey hawkins act after the bill's sponsors humphrey hawkins charges the federal reserve to pursue full employment and price stability the central bank must also set targets for different monetary aggregates and provide a semi annual monetary policy report to congress despite this the employment half of the mandate appeared to be more important when there was a conflict between full employment and inflation as fed chairman arthur burns would later claim full employment was the primary objective in the publix and government's eyes if not also in those of the federal reserve however it was also clear that trying to solve the inflation problem would have been too costly for the economy and jobs there have been a few previous attempts to reduce inflation without the additional burden of higher unemployment the nixon administration put in place wage and price controls in three different phases between and the controls only temporarily slowed the rise in prices however i hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed this made the shortages worse especially for food and energy the ford administration had no better luck when they tried to control inflation after declaring inflation enemy number one the tyranny of double digit inflation is our common enemy in the president in introduced the whip inflation now program this voluntary program had measures to encourage people to save more money but it failed by the late s the general public had come to expect an inflationary bias in monetary policy and they were increasingly unhappy with inflation many surveys showed that the public lost confidence in the economy and government policy during the second half of the s and often inflation was identified as a special evil interest rates appear to be on a secular rise since and spiked sharply higher still as the s came to a close during this time business investments slowed down in productivity weakened the nation's trade balance with other countries worsened and inflation was seen as a major cause of the economic problems or the main reason for them but once policymakers found themselves in a position with high inflation and high unemployment they faced an unhappy dilemma is very difficult to fight high unemployment and inflation at the same time if you try to fight high inflation it could cause the unemployment rate to go up in paul volcker who had previously served as the president of the federal reserve bank of new york was named chairman of the federal reserve board when he took office in august the inflation rate year over year was more than percent and the unemployment rate was close to percent by this time it was generally accepted that reducing inflation requires controlling the growth rate of reserves and money in general the federal open market committee had already started to set goals for how much money should be in the economy this is required by a law called the humphrey hawkins act however it was clear that sentiment was changing with the new chairman and that stronger measures to control the growth of the money supply were required in october the federal open market committee announced that it would target reserve growth instead of the fed fund's rate as its policy instrument even if it had the effect of temporarily disrupting economic activity and for a time increasing joblessness inflation was now seen as essential to both aims of the dual mandate in early volker said my basic philosophy is over time we have no choice but to deal with the inflationary situation because over time inflation and the unemployment rate go together volcker had tried to get the fed governors to nudge interest rates upward without success so he tried a different attack persuading them to focus on controlling the money supply it was a sleight of hand because the two are essentially the same but it was a politically palatable tactic and it worked and when he slowed the money growth rate predictably the interest rate went way up over time the desired slowing of inflation was achieved by having greater control over reserve and money growth although this was not perfect it worked well enough this tighter reserve management was made stricter with the introduction of credit controls in early and with a monetary control act interest rates changed a lot in they went out then down for a bit and then would back up again lending activity fell unemployment rose and the economy went into a brief recession between january and july inflation fell but was still high even as the economy recovered in the second half of however the volcker fed continued to fight high inflation with a combination of higher interest rates and slower reserve growth in july the economy fell into a recession again which proved to be more severe and drawn out than the previous one unemployment peaked at nearly percent but inflation continued to move lower and by the recession's end year over year inflation was back under percent in time the fed's commitment to low inflation gained credibility and unemployment drop as a result of strong economic growth the great inflation was over yeah i think it's fair to say that was a difficult time by this time a macroeconomic theory had changed dramatically as a result of the economic lessons of the era in macroeconomic models the essential function that public expectations play in the link between economic policy and economic performance has become standard practice making time consistent policy choices choices that don't sacrifice long term prosperity for short term gains and having policy credibility are important for good macroeconomic results today central banks understand that a commitment to price stability is essential for good monetary policy most central banks including the federal reserve have adopted specific numerical objectives for inflation these numerical inflation targets have helped to control inflation by providing an anchor for monetary policy and in so doing they have also increased transparency and reduced uncertainty now recognized to be critical prerequisites for long term development and maximum employment so what can we learn from the great inflation of the s for one it's a reminder that economic policies have real world consequences it also underscores the importance of keeping an eye on inflation and all other economic indicators to avoid nasty surprises down the road finally it serves as a cautionary tale about giving central bankers too much power something we should bear in mind as we watch current events unfold here at home"", ""inflation is back on that basically everybody agrees however an intense debate is currently raging about whether or not inflation is here to stay or whether it is just a temporary blip the position that inflation is high now but will soon return to its normal level is championed by team transitory this team consists of heavy hitters such as u s treasury secretary janet yellen ecb president christine lagarde and nobel prize winning economists joseph stiglitz on the other side of the field we have team persistent which beliefs that elevated levels of inflation are here to stay and might even increase in the near future it is represented by prominent economists such as larry central bankers like the ex president of the german bundesbank jens weidman and very very vocally by investors such as peter schiff but who should you believe hi i am joeri and to help you make sense of it all i will first go over the basics of inflation then i will summarize what might be causing it and then for each cause why team transitory team permanent believe what they believe what's more for each cause myself and uk academic youtuber and well known rebel of the economics profession unlearning economics will evaluate the evidence and also the case made by team transitory and team permanent okay let's quickly review the basics inflation is a simultaneous increase in all prices in the economy so this does not mean that all prices have gone up by the same magnitude it just means that on average prices have gone up this sounds straightforward in theory however in practice inflation is insanely difficult to measure after all to measure average prices you would have to keep record of the size and price of each transaction in the economy in most economies this is not possible since privacy laws prevent economists from going through your bank records and even if they could it is surprisingly difficult to determine what has been purchased just from bank records if you don't believe me just have a look at one of friends bank account statement from last month and try to figure out what they purchased to get around these problems economists have constructed a basket of goods services that is supposed to represent what a household spends on average this is the consumer price index or cpi for short for each good or service the cpi basket not only consists of a price but also of a weight that reflects how much important this good or service is for households on average for example since average households spend a lot on rent but not on supporting this channel via patreon an increase in rent prices will affect the cpi a lot whereas me increasing the prices of my patreon tiers will not so what are these weights well as you can see here in the usa and europe weights are fairly similar the bulk of household expenses go to housing costs as well as to food and transportation notably though us lazy europeans spend quite a bit more on recreation however when comparing inflation in europe and the states one notable difference is the inclusion of house prices controversially neither the european nor the american cpi includes house prices directly i know this sounds absolutely mad since house prices have gone through the roof in both areas importantly house prices have risen much faster than rents which are included in the cpi however you can't just include house prices in the cpi for two reasons the first is that a house is not just used for 'consumption ' it is also used as an investment and the dynamics of consumption and investment goods are very different simply put you as a consumer would not be very happy if the price of a consumption good like i don't know graphics cards goes up but if you invested in say gamestop stocks and its price went through the roof you would be very very happy the second reason why you can't just include house prices is that the price of a house is not the same as what it costs you the main reason for this is that most people borrow to buy a house for example i just bought a house at a price that was much higher than my parents did however i borrowed at close to a interest rate while my parents borrowed at you'd have to take that into account in the cpi to deal with these problems in the americans added a new category to the cpi called owner's equivalent rent owner's equivalent rent gets around these problems by just asking home owners a simple question if someone were to rent your home today how much do you think it would rent for monthly unfurnished and without utilities the idea here is that if house prices go up like crazy owner equivalent rent will go up but if mortgage interest rates go down at the same as they have in both europe and the usa owner equivalent rent will rise far slower than house prices as you can imagine this measure is not perfect however it is better than leaving it out like the europeans after all how much does rent say if like in the netherlands roughly of people are home owners rather than renters so in europe it could very well be that inflation was actually a bit higher than reported since house prices and maintenance costs have gone up like crazy whereas interest rates have gone down a little bit so with these weights known to calculate cpi economists simply retrieve an average price for everything in the basket and multiply it by their respective weights to then calculate yearly inflation all economists need to do is look at changes in cpi simple right wellll not really because cpi weights have one big problem and that is that they change over time after all if the cpi was calculated in there was a likely a significant weight on the price candles however the weight for the price of internet would be non existent therefore economists update the cpi weights every so often however here the pandemic lockdowns caused a big problem by completely changing consumer behaviour in an instance at the same time the cpi weights had already been determined at the start of the simply put in households started buying far more goods and far fewer services this pushed up the price of goods more than it made the price of services drop at the same time this drastically increased the number of goods people consumed but not their weight in the cpi therefore actual inflation in was likely quite a bit higher than official inflation taking this into account research by harvard professor cavalla estimated that official cpi in the us likely was likely too low this can partially explain why we see such shocking inflation numbers today but then the question becomes by how much well according to my own calculations if cavalla was right us inflation this year would only have be rather than the reported while that is still a very high number it does demonstrate that we shouldn't just take headline inflation numbers and run with them to produce sensationalist youtube videos another reason is that lockdown also messed up the service price data collection for example while they were closed restaurants did not technically have a price this means that while the fundamental factors driving these prices such as wages and food prices might have continued to rise the economists measuring cpi weren't able to see that in restaurant prices because they weren't being posted therefore they just assumed these prices remained the same that year while i couldn't find an estimate for how big this effect was however it does mean that inflation in was likely even more understated and thus inflation today is even more overstated the combination of these two effects has been dubbed base effects base effects are mostly emphasized by team transitory in an attempt to re assure us that current high inflation numbers will drop once covid stops messing with the statistics inflation collapsed last year when lockdowns were imposed which is creating strong base effects as activity recovers that being said some of us are again in a lockdown and many are still afraid to go to restaurants or to travel so it could be that inflation is still understated today or even if current headline numbers are overstated thanks to base effects both team transitory and team permanent do agree that inflation still very high today so the debate is still on but before we can assess both positions we need to do a quick recap of the three ways that inflation can come about but first if you are watching this video it likely means that you are intrinsically motivated to understand inflation and willing to recognize how complex this problem really is so if that is you i am happy to report that the sponsor of this video has an economist treasurer job opportunity for you for the economist part you will be asked to figure out how to create a global stable coin that is stable but not backed by a single fiat currency such as the dollar for the treasury part you will be asked to get hands on and manage a portfolio of assets that aligns with that goal now i honestly believe that this is a very unique and interesting job because i had an open and critical conversation about the project and its purpose with reserve's ceo nevin freeman i've linked to the highlights of that conversation in the description of this video and there you will find more information about the job and how to apply to it to understand what causes inflation economists typically use the age old concepts of supply and demand however for a macroeconomic concept such as inflation they use total also known as aggregate supply and demand you see if aggregate demand rises faster than aggregate supply average price will rise and if aggregate supply rises faster than aggregate demand prices will fall now what is nice about this framework is that helps us to better understand inflation by breaking the problem down into smaller pieces for example if aggregate demand rises faster than aggregate supply economists classify this as demand pull inflation on the other hand if aggregate supply falls but aggregate demand remains the same they call this supply push inflation now hold on let me just interrupt you writing an angry comment that the internet told you that inflation is caused by money printing we will get to this under the demand pull inflation section but first let's address the supply chain disruptions that both camps agree on is a major source of inflation today both teams recognize that we have seen a perfect supply push inflation storm these last few months the first big contributor this this has been a massive energy crisis one part of this story are flooded coal mines in china and fires near oil fields in canada another part of the story is that certain princes in saudi arabia have turned off the oil tap and certain presidents have turned off the gas tap for political reasons but there is also just an energy sector that hadn't invested for a long time because energy prices had been so low for so long then global covid lockdowns have contributed in two ways first they have shut down production in countries affected for example very recently a renewed shutdown in malaysia where a lot of the world s chip testing and packaging is done has reduced chip production by so much that it forced ford to suspend its u s production of the f trucks the second effect of covid lockdowns has been to disrupt global supply chains by for example shutting down ports in china in a global supply chain that ran on maximum efficiency but minimal buffers this has greatly driven up transport prices and on top of that it slowed down production and contributed to global supply push inflation even more by how much you might ask well in all honesty that is very difficult to properly estimate but just to get an idea researchers from the bank for international settlements have recently estimated that without supply disruptions inflation would have been at least and lower in the usa europe respectively and you know what even larry summers from team permanent recognizes that annual inflation last month according to core cpi was above the majority of that is surely transient for a large part the disagreement is just about how temporary supply chain disruptions will last here the position of team permanent is best captured by the following quote from german central banker jens weidman the supply side bottlenecks of the kind we are seeing for semiconductors might turn out to be more persistent in addition if we want to meet the climate targets there will be no getting around significantly higher carbon prices that will drive energy prices for many years on the other hand team transitory members like ecb president christine lagarde have stated that they believe supply bottlenecks to end early next year although that quote was before the emergence of the new covid variant the most extreme position taken by members of team transitory is best captured by the analogy of the bottleneck economy from the financial time's martin sandbu he thinks that our current supply chain situation could be comparable to a ketchup bottle where we are shaking and shaking but no products are coming out thanks to backed up supply chains but as we speak big manufacturers are building new factories and containers all over the world and once these are done the product ketchup might come out all at the same time leading to potentially severe supply push deflation to a certain extend this has already happened with lumber and steel which were huge concerns for inflation at the start of the pandemic but have since come down in price so ue what do you think about the supply chain push effect and which team is more right than the other team well generally speaking i do think that supply chains are something we need to be worrying about when we are talking about inflation looking at specific goods and sectors and how they are affected by things whether it is the pandemic or not is really important and that is especially true for things like energy which you have been discussing which underpin the entire economy so i do think that this is the right place to look in terms of whether this is going to permanent or transitory it seems to me that a lot of this has been affected by the pandemic and these are going to be transitory factors most of which are going to go away but i will say that with one possible caveat which you raised which i think is going to be very important if we see further disruptions due to climate change and if we see government shifting away from non renewable energy not in a smooth fashion then we might see further problems and those can have an effect on the rest of the economy so energy is definitely the one to watch for the future but in terms of the immediate danger i don t think there is too much to worry about yeah alright fair enough i think that i broadly agree with that the one thing that i would like to add the one thing that i would like to add is that i was quite confident about the effects of lockdowns going away but with the vaccines efficacy waning a little bit and with delta being much more ravaging especially in emerging market economies where a lot of these factories are it will obviously also be transitory in the long run but it might actually take quite a bit longer than we expected yeah i think it is important to caveat that transitory basically means for as long as the pandemic and lockdown persist so you are right you know not enough is being done so that globally we move past the pandemic as much as possible and when it comes to the energy one i also broadly agree with you and see the concern of jens weidman specifically about this actually taking longer but i did also read some interesting articles from adam tooze for example whom you might know stating that the climate change factor is a bit overblown and what they cite is that after the paris agreement there was not really a lot less investment into fossil fuel industries and that it could also be a consequence of energy prices dropping significantly in i think it was and that this industry is super cyclical right so that investment not being done then might still reverberate today and that we might actually rather quickly see a reversal of fortunes there what do you think of that one yeah i haven t read that tooze article but that sounds sensible to me i would say certainly it is about how the transition is managed as long as there aren t too many sudden changes we should be able to cope with the transition and as long as there is enough investment in renewable energy to replace the non renewables then it shouldn t be a problem but i think it is definitely something to keep an eye on now what happens if people try to buy so much stuff that an economies production just can't keep up that's right demand pull inflation and you know this is the one that gets both teams really worked because these millionaires and billionaires are just really concerned about the fate of the lower middle classes of course for example investor peter schiff from team permanent typically stresses the dangers of giving money to people who don't produce anything this is what happened under covid we were expanding the money supply at the same time people were not working people were leaving their jobs they weren't being productive they weren't producing goods they weren't producing services yet the federal reserve flooded the economy with new money and so even though people didn't work they were spending more money than they did when they were still employed and so you have all this money chasing a declining goods and services and so prices are exploding and he typically argues that the resulting inflation will come at the expense of the middle class after all they spend a large fraction of their income the goods services that will be affected by inflation at same time nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz from team transitory argues that more demand than supply is actually good for the working middle class because it increases wages so you are absolutely right i'm welcoming this tight labor market the only time united states has succeeded in including marginalized groups into the labour force reducing inequality is when we have a very tight labour market this contradiction may seem confusing at first until you realise they are talking about different channels of demand pull inflation you could say that schiff is talking about the money printing channel stiglitz about the overheating labour market channel let's tackle the one that the internet loves the most first money printing to view money printing as the source of all price inflation actually has a very long tradition in economics the most prominent economist to support this idea was nobel prize winner milton friedman who said that the reason we have inflation in the united states or for that matter anywhere in the world is because these pieces of papers and the accompanying book entry or their counterparts in other nations are growing more rapidly than the quantity of goods and services produced his thinking was inspired by one of the most famous equations in economics and that is the quantity theory of money which states that money velocity of money prices quantities this equation is true by definition you can see this by looking at the following example if in an economy there were dollars and these exchanged hands once and there were two loafs of bread in the economy then we can deduce that the price of each bread was dollar now in itself this equation is an accounting identity which means that it only tells us that there can be a relationship between these variables but it doesn't tell us what that relationship will be crucially friedman inspired economists often assume that velocity and production are roughly constant remember that clip from peter schiff arguing that stimulus checks for people at home would be inflationary crucially he made the implicit assumption there that this didn't prevent a further collapse of production if the money supply is increased while velocity and production stay roughly the same this new money will lead to an increase in average demand and so prices will go up then it makes sense to say everything is getting more expensive and if people think that is transitory it is because they don't understand the problem in fact they don't even understand inflation or where it comes from because inflation is about money you are inflating the money supply that's what's being expanded and none of this is transitory because these deficits aren't transitory the money printing isn't transitory it's here to stay and that means prices are going to continue to go up because we continue to destroy the value of the dollar as we expand the supply sounds pretty convincing right however the monetary theory of inflation has almost completely disappeared from universities why well because the data doesn't support this simple explanation in most economies for example check out this graph of the cpi for europe and compare it to the graph of central bank printed m money supply you can clearly see that the money supply has accelerated while price growth has slowed to a less extend this disconnect also exists for the usa but if you really want to see this simple theory fail you only need to look at japan even if we take into account the more expansive m money supply measure which include money created by private banks and compare it to the cpi you can clearly see that while m kept going up the cpi had its ups and downs what can explain this disconnect using the quantity theory of money framework it must mean that either production has increased or velocity has slowed down or a little bit of both of course if velocity indeed slowed this means people saved money rather than spent it and this should be reflected in higher asset prices or lower interest rates indeed in europe and japan we have seen falling interest rates and rising asset prices at this point members of team permanent might say that okay okay but people will start spending all of that money at some point and then cases will truly explode but again if we look at japan they have been waiting for almost years now so team permanent should come up with an explanation why would people suddenly start spending all their money the only explanation i could find is one made by economists charles goodhart and manoj pradhan if i pronounce that correctly they say that as people got older they were saving for retirement but as many countries are now ageing the elderly should start switching from saving to spending more however japan is again a problem because here this didn't happen however they argue that japan is unique because many japanese companies moved production facilities abroad to neighbouring countries that didn't really have this ageing problem as the world in total gets older this would not be possible anymore but okay that is the future what about inflation today because let's face it saying that increases in the money supply don't always push up prices does not mean that they never push up inflation and indeed even members of team transitory such as joseph stiglitz recognize that by giving new money to the poorest us government support has likely contributed to inflation however he says this is temporary because the fiscal support is coming to an end and i am firmly off the believe that it is the fiscal support that's made the most difference so two questions that i want to discuss here with unlearning economics how important is the monetary factor and how likely is it that governments will continue stimulating the economy alright ue what do you think about these two points well i think the monetary factor is perhaps more indirect than people like peter schiff have thought but perhaps than economists in general have thought for the past few decades if you look at the effects of interest rates on business decisions it actually seems to be rather small the economist nathan tankers has written quite a lot on this and i think that what you have seen really over the last few decades especially in the usa and also in the uk is that the back of the labour movement has been broken and so what you ve had is a decline in union density and that people like paul volcker who were obsessed with unions you ve seen actually that wage growth has been relatively subdued even with low unemployment and so i think that has played a big role perhaps more so than monetary factors and so i think that people end up overstating the role of monetary policy and especially with someone like peter schiff what you get is he is almost defining inflation as an increase in the money supply while of course that is not what inflation means what inflation means is the increase in prices which may or may not result in the increase of the money supply and you know we are just not seeing the kind of increase in prices that people like him are predicting yeah you know this is actually interesting because a lot of people often tell me this in my comment section as well they say that inflation is actually an increase in the money supply and then i looked it up and apparently this was the old definition of inflation in the early th century i totally agree with you that it is very confusing to mix up old definitions with new definitions absolutely and i mean that definition of inflation has some use because we need to understand what is happening to the money supply eh why are people worried about inflation well i don t think the aggregate m measure of the money supply is really of much concern to most people i think they are worried about prices and wages and about how those things affect them so i think that whatever you want to call it maybe we can call it something else but we are not seeing the rise in price that people like peter schiff are predicting and what do you think of using the quantity theory of money in general in this type of context is it still useful well this is a big debate isn t it i am of the opinion that is has probably done more harm than good which isn t the same as saying that it can have absolutely no use but generally speaking i think it overstates the degree that the central bank has on the money supply that is actually in circulation by itself the quantity theory of money doesn t do this but it has led to these kinds of overstatements and you saw this with targeting the money supply they tried that based largely on reasoning of the quantity theory of money and it didn t really work and just more generally i think the mechanism from central bank actions into financial markets and an expansion of the money being used in circulation that mechanism is much weaker than we think therefore i don t think that increase in m therefore increase in p y is a very reliable mechanism yeah right i totally agree and i think most academic economists also agree and that is basically why they stopped using the quantity theory of money that much because especially when you look at velocity that has just totally been fluctuating wildly and it and it seems that a lot of money that used to be chasing goods and services is finding its way to financial markets therefore leading financial market inflation and not regular inflation right absolutely you mentioned the definition of inflation as too much money chasing too few goods and services right or you alluded to it which i think is the common definition of inflation which is a good starting point as is the quantity theory of money but as you said and as we discussed earlier with supply chains it might be a good idea to look at the specifics what is going on in supply chains what is going on in the labour market what is going on in financial markets and things like that to get a better understanding of inflation yeah okay excellent well that leads us to a nice segway into the next section which is about the labour markets and still the demand pull angle but then from the philips curve perspective but before we get into that what do you think about fiscal stimulus in particular do you think it will reverse or do you think it will remain fairly loose i am cautiously optimistic about this and i have actually been very surprised by the extend to which have expanded social insurance i mean in the usa where of course us europeans always like to take the piss out of them for not having a very good welfare state they have actually seen poverty decline during the pandemic and you see biden coming to office and he seems to be quite keen to expand spending you know in areas like care and renewable energy as well as the typical infrastructure and in the uk you have seen rishi sunak with a fairly moderate but expansionary budget recently so i am quite cautiously optimistic about this perhaps it has changed our relationship with government spending because you don t see people worrying about the debt anymore and they have seen you know governments can do things they can do more than we had thought and the money is available and the money is available and as a european i would like to add that weirdly the european union has also not gone into full austerity mode just yet one thing that i do notice when you say this what i find interesting is that when you say okay i am cautiously optimist about that might cause some inflation and there might be some inflationary pressures from that especially in the usa that is than an argument for team permanent somewhat from this side right if i hear that correctly so if governments continue spending it might increase inflation but actually this relates to a bit of a broader point to how we think about inflation there is a resurgence of we can call it supply side leftism or something like that right the notion that in spending money perhaps by expanding capacity in renewable energy for example governments can actually expand the supply side as well as the demand side and therefore we might see growth without necessarily excessive inflation i am willing to believe that inflation might rise to but in terms of too much inflation as long as the government spending is oriented on the supply as well as the demand side i don t see that happening okay so just to tie that into the quantity theory of money before we move on that is an argument where you are saying well q products will be rising partly from an increase in m from government spending right yeah exactly exactly and this is one of the things with the quantity theory of money right if everything is changing at once and not independently then it becomes less useful as a guide to policy yeah yeah totally agreed okay now let's put a different spin on the demand pull inflation channel are there any non monetary ways that overall demand might outpace overall supply yes the theory of inflation that is most popular in universities is related to the philips curve the philips curve plots the relationship between unemployment and inflation the idea behind this is that if unemployment is low the economy is running close to or at its full capacity this means that workers have a lot of money to spend and that not much more can be produced so while wages are likely to rise with labour in such high demand aggregate supply cannot keep up and thus we will see demand pull inflation if this is true we should now see signs of an overheating economy labour shortages trucker shortages and what not but do we let's have a look at the evidence both in europe and the united states the unemployment rate shot up at the start of the pandemic and then came back almost to the low rates that we saw before the pandemic when there really wasn't a lot of inflation so that is not particularly alarming however unemployment rates might not tell the full story here because they only include people who are actively looking for a job it could be that very well be that workers don't feel like returning to the w"", ""while the world comes out of economic recession due to the pandemic a lot of things are changing high inflation stimulus packages interest rates all these words are popping up on the news but it's hard to figure out how does the whole system work in this video we explain all of that and more let's start with hyperinflation inflation is the rate that shows how much the price for goods and services rise a low inflation rate is the norm in most countries around the world the u s inflation rate for example in was percent in the euro zone percent the american economist philip kagan was the first to classify hyper inflation he stated that the phenomenon happens when a country's inflation rate exceeds percent per month there are different reasons this happens even though each case is unique there are common patterns for example in most cases the economy is already weak and there is a shock caused by war international isolation or natural disasters the road to hyperinflation usually comes after a chain of events and it usually happens as follows tax revenues are drastically reduced the reason can be external factors like war a sudden change in commodities prices or country specific reasons like political transition bad monetary policies and even corruption the government starts printing money the supply of money pushes inflation up the rise impacts government revenues the country experiences a period of high inflation affecting the government's budget and confidence in its institutions the government then prints more money and resorts to measures that fail to control inflation the inflation rate accelerates the currency value collapses inflation explodes country experiences hyperinflation before the first world war cases of hyperinflation were rare prices rose during the french revolution and american civil war but hyperinflation is mostly a modern phenomenon the following ranking was created by economists steve hankey and nicholas cruz so here we go let's see which countries produce the five worst cases of hyperinflation in the last years number five greece this is greece the country that gave us democracy philosophers and probably the world's earliest currency units the drachma it is also the country that experienced the fifth worst case of hyperinflation in history the worst month was october when the inflation rate was percent the new york times reported that month that one dollar was worth million drachmas in the port of patras to understand how the situation got that bad it is important to go back four years the country was occupied by the axis forces during the second world war the new government added to its expenses the support of its army which had approximately four hundred thousand soldiers this expense represented between one third to three fifths of all the country's expenditures during that time and notes advanced from the greek bank paid the bill when the occupation ended tax revenues covered only six percent of total expenditures another point of instability that contributed to the hyperinflation was the government's policy of paying with gold sovereigns a british gold coin this reduced public trust in the economy and added uncertainty to the situation in a british gold coin could be exchanged for drachma by december it could be exchanged for trillion drachma in october the exiled greek government returned and implemented plans to curtail inflation the country continued to be plagued with political instability internal conflicts and other difficulties post war greece was marked by other inflationary periods the country joined the european union in and adopted the euro in since then inflation remains under control number germany one of the most famous hyperinflation periods in history happened in germany during the weimar republic events took a dramatic turn in october when wholesale prices increased by percent a loaf of bread in cost marks by september the price had increased to billion in november it was billion the situation got so extreme that people were paid out at an hourly basis workers rushed to stores to secure food and produce before prices soared again the prices doubled every days on average it was normal to see people carrying money in wheelbarrows restaurants stopped displaying menus it was pointless by the time a person finished eating prices had gone up salaries and pensions lost their value fast a university teacher an esteemed position in society that came with a respectable salary could no longer feed his family a combination of factors led to this nightmare after the first world war the country had to shoulder the blame for starting the conflict pay exorbitant reparations relinquish control of colonies and territories and limit the size of its army all of this would already be a source of destabilization but there was more germany had used bonds to fund the war the plan was to conquer territories and pay the debt back with the conquered money but in reality the new republic was created already with a colossal debt resulting from pre war bonds some economists estimate that it was probably around percent of the gdp with no option of a bailout quite the opposite germany needed to pay reparations to the other countries in hard currency the government then started printing money to pay its debt and to buy foreign currency the more it printed the more the currency tanked and inflation rose people realized money had lost its value and rushed to spend this created a vicious circle in a dollar was valued at around marks by november the exchange rate for a single us dollar was trillion marks the situation was stabilized somewhat by a new currency backed with hard assets in but by then millions of middle class germans had lost their savings this period was so traumatic that some people say to this day it still haunts the public and continues to be an influential factor in the country's debt aversion number three yugoslavia taking third place on the podium the bronze medal goes to the federal republic of yugoslavia in the first month of the inflation rate rose million percent during this time you would be able to buy a loaf of bread with a million dinar note that's it just one the situation got so crazy that the cost of a pack of cigarettes in the morning would be the equivalent of one cigarette in the evening the money value was so high that the government kept introducing new plans to cut the zeros it didn't work the situation continued to deteriorate on january st the government knocked nine zeros off the notes with a monetary plan by the last week of the same month it had already printed a million dinar note to understand how this happened we need to look at the disintegration of the former socialist republic of yugoslavia from june to march slovenia croatia macedonia and bosnia herzegovina declared independence the remaining two countries serbia and montenegro formed what was called the federal republic of yugoslavia the war that followed independence led to international sanctions which include a trade embargo the country relied heavily on imports and the effects of sanctions had a huge impact on the economy the country had four regional central banks in addition to the official one all of them some of them illegally conducted credit provisions and issued dinar notes without oversight the newly formed federal republic had also two outside republics formed by ethnic serbian majorities republica srpska in bosnian herzegovina and the republic of serbian cryina in croatia these two republics also went through hyperinflation periods with similar magnitude the republican serbsca for example had an inflation rate of million percent in january later in the government created a new monetary plan with a new currency backed by the german mark after that inflation decreased to double digit levels in annual terms which persisted for years following montenegro's independence in the country ceased to exist number zimbabwe the silver medal goes to the most recent case on our list zimbabwe the african country had the world's second highest inflation in the first of the st century in november the prices increased billion percent a bag of sugar cost about billion zimbabwe dollars and salaries of unskilled workers were around billion that was the equivalent of a month billion zimbabwean dollars got you eggs and an average retirement pension paid out billion which at one point was worth less than one dollar to understand what led to this we need to understand history after years of fighting between the white regime and black nationalists zimbabwe gained independence in robert mugabe emerged as a national leader and was able to consolidate his powers during his government he moved toward an authoritarian regime of one party rule and joined the first congo war in and the second in in he promoted the fast track land reform program which seized wide owned land without any compensation ignoring a former joint effort with the british government to make that possible the central bank started lending directly to new farmers to finance the operations this led to farmers being replaced by inexperienced sometimes first time landowners together with the impact of severe droughts agricultural production and exports declined significantly as a result the economy stagnated food shortages and riots started to take place the involvement in the wars and accusations of human rights violations raised international criticism and the country became increasingly isolated all the uncertainty had a profound effect on the foreign investments which fell from million dollars in to million dollars in since its independence there was no year that the government had a balanced budget and never a surplus when inflation accelerated the government tried measures like redenomination of the currency limiting on money withdrawal and a price freeze hyperinflation followed and the population moved to foreign currencies which exacerbated the situation in the country created a multi currency dollarization system that replaced the zimbabwe dollar although it calmed the situation for a while until today even after mugabe's deposition via a coup in there are still reports that the inflation rate is above percent in the country number one hungary hungary experienced after the second world war what is to this day the world record in inflation the country had an inflation rate of quadrillion percent in july historians recall that the famous hungarian poet george falooti was paid billion pego by his publisher with the money he was able to buy one chicken one liter of olive oil and a few vegetables at a local budapest market during this time prices were doubling every hours with such high inflation people started to rely on the black market the desperation of the government was so big that it imposed the death penalty for dealings in black market trade in a note with a face value of quintillion pego was issued until today no banknote with a higher denomination was ever issued the roots of this nightmare are in the war damage lack of reserves reparations costs of occupation among other reasons after the war the situation was catastrophic in total economists estimate that percent of hungary's non human wealth was destroyed this had a huge effect on the production capacity and put pressure on prices the soviets signed the armistice with hungary and set reparation costs at million dollars which included the removal of equipment the hungarians also had to pay for soviet troops stationed in the country according to estimates hungary's after war bill was between and million dollars with a huge deficit and isolated hungary had no other option than printing money it printed so much that currency circulation passed from billion pango in july to trillion by january reached quadrillion by may and septillion pango by july in the hungarian government announced a reform created a new currency and stipulated rules such as new central bank regulations to government loans prices started falling and went back to normal in the following months as we saw hyperinflation happens when a government loses control of its economy next we will see how the system works and how is this possible since officially abandoning the gold standard in the dollar is what economists call fiat money the word fiat comes from latin and is often translated as a decree but in summary the term means that the money is not backed by a physical asset like gold or silver pretty much every currency in the world is fiat money and their value fluctuates in relation to each other having a currency with no backing makes it easier to control the supply of money for example this is helpful in moments of crisis and recession when the government's resort to measures to inject money and revive the economy where there's an upside there are also downsides some see this as the disadvantages of the system to understand both sides of this problem let's take a closer look at where the trillions of dollars that are part of corona relief packages come from to afford this amount of money the government needs to increase its debts dramatically one of the ways of doing that is issuing bonds government bonds are debt securities an instrument used to raise money and support spending obligations bonds are basically a document in which a lender like a bank agrees to lend money to the government and in return the debt can be repaid at a later date with interest depending on the country the bonds are issued in they vary on interest rates and dates that need to be repaid in the case of the united states the treasury department sells the issued bonds during auctions throughout the year issuing bonds is a standard procedure in normal circumstances there is a market to absorb the bonds without a big fuss but when we are talking about sudden trillions of dollars things are not that simple and the role played by the federal reserve also known as fed is what makes things controversial in theory the fed is independent and its main goal is to promote maximum employment stable prices and manage long term interest rates in the united states but in extraordinary cases such as the relief packages the fed also functions as a buyer buying most of the government bonds issued in the first corona relief package during donald trump's presidency the fed signaled its willingness to essentially buy an unlimited amount of government debt the fed is not allowed to buy bonds directly from the government it needs to buy on what is called open market operations it can be bought from the so called primary dealers this includes the big banks and brokers like jp morgan goldman sachs and others for example once the fed buys the equivalent of one trillion dollars in bonds from these institutions it injects the same amount of money into the bank reserves facilitates lending and increases the money supply and circulation it's direct money being injected into the economy money that didn't exist until the fed bought the bonds moreover the fed is no ordinary bond holder by law it has to pay its profits to the treasury at the end of the day when the treasury pays interest on bonds this money generated by bonds that becomes a profit goes back to the government at the same time that the fed acts on open market operations it also cuts its benchmark interest rate reducing the cost of borrowing when businesses and people borrow more it also increases the amount of money in circulation for the critics these measures to stimulate the economy are just loopholes in the system an unofficial way of an endless supply of money without actually printing it there is risk to long term stability and can lead to inflation devaluation of the dollar and eventually collapse of the economy but is the fed over stimulating the economy with open market operations to understand the situation it's possible to look into the fed's balance sheet which consists of assets like bonds and liabilities owned by the bank the total amount went from trillion dollars in the last week of february to trillion in the first week of february not all of these are government bonds but this number gives us an idea of how much the fed has been acting during this crisis since the dollar is fiat money there are no limits to issue debt and also no limits for the fed to act and buy the bonds supplying the government with more money and more dollars available can also affect its value if the united states had a currency backed by something the fed would not be able to expand the money supply to such an excessive amount for example if the fed tried to do that while on the gold standard it would cause the dollar value to fall due to oversupply compared to its gold parity and compromise the basis of the system for the pessimists this is putting us on a trajectory of crisis and the collapse is inevitable so again in a nutshell this is how the cycle of collapse would work everything starts with the currency backed by a physical asset in the dollar case until it was gold the precious mineral gave value to currency and created a level of confidence that led to the expansion of commerce and credit but with the currency attached to gold there is a limit on how much credit is possible to generate plus the system is affected by the amount of gold mined in the world and very exposed to speculation as the country needs to always keep currency value in parity with the gold reserves this limitation led to the idea that gold backing the dollar was not beneficial the country then leaves the system the fiat model comes in through a decree remember what fiat means what follows is euphoria the system is flooded with liquidity stimulus packages increasing spending in many areas increase in trade this leads to abuse government starts spending more than it should and monetizes even more of its debts to fund its obligations slowly the economic growth starts to decline and confidence starts to fade inflation begins rising all confidence is lost hyperinflation follows and the economy collapses a new government creates a new system with a new currency backed by a physical asset the cycle begins anew critics believe we are at a stage where the government is starting to lose its confidence inflation inevitably will start to rise and be followed by hyperinflation and collapse but is there any truth behind this pessimist view well there isn't a consensus but it's fair to say that the majority of economists would disagree with the forecast one of the most critical of these views is nobel prize laureate and new york times columnist paul krugman as proof that pessimism is unfounded he points to the aftermath of the financial crisis from the start of the economic crisis until the fed's balance sheet also grew exponentially more than four trillion dollars and still inflation stayed low krugman believes that the risks aren't greater now he believes that for the most part the funds that the fed injected into the economy simply piled up either in the bank reserves or in cash held by individuals and are not harmful the fed's latest bond buying spree is an evolution of what began finding acceptance considered normal during the financial crisis ben bernanke former chair of the fed during that time also hit back at the critics for him what the fed was doing wasn't printing money to finance government borrowing but a temporary measure that would be reversed eventually the fed sells the bonds it acquired and things go back to normal although they believe the practice isn't harmful to the economy long term it's important to point out the growing level of debt in the united states according to the congressional budget office was the first year since that the country's debt exceeded the size of the entire economy the u s had a total debt held by the public of trillion the equivalent of percent of gdp by the country is projected to hold trillion dollars in debt percent of gdp they also project that the debt will represent percent of gdp by when it should surpass trillion dollars does that mean that there is no way out of the crisis and a collapse is about to happen it's impossible to predict but generally speaking there are no signs that the financial market is worried about the growing deficit the fact is despite the huge debt the u s government is not financially constrained it has no problem borrowing money in borrowing is very cheap with the year interest rate barely above one percent funnily enough the market sees this as a positive sign and the country would be able to keep going and borrowing forever under the current circumstances moreover with expected percent gdp growth in the next decade any debt would tend to melt away as a share of gdp over time for now it seems like the full faith and credit of the united states is more than enough for investors we will have to wait and see for how long how would the economy be if we still have the gold standard would we be better or worse off let's take a look every once in a while the gold standard goes back into fashion the world has moved on from currencies attached to the precious metal for fifty years but discussions around the topic are more vivid than ever to understand why going back to the gold standard is still appealing to some people we need to dive into what are the disadvantages and advantages of the system the biggest argument pro gold standard has to do with safety and stability one can argue that gold retains a stable value to the currency and this theoretically could reduce the risk of instability and economic crises with a fixed asset backing the money's value governments wouldn't be able to raise their debts without first buying more gold for some people especially those who worry about hyper inflation and do not trust governments or central banks the gold standard is a great tool to legally curb government spending and the money supply into society according to this thought with the currency attached to limited physical assets like gold the risks of debt spiraling out of control followed by inflationary periods are smaller and long term stability safety and prosperity would follow supporters of the gold standard believe that the system does not allow the government to resort to expansionary measures as it seems fit or what critics usually say simply print more money to finance new debt and let's be honest the us debt problem is getting bigger by the day at the end of the us government debt held by the public was at more than trillion dollars a little bit more than the whole gdp as a comparison that's much more than what the country owns in gold the u s gold reserves were valued at trillion dollars by the end of if we look at the historical graph of united states debt since we can clearly see a path look at it here that's when the country left the gold standard now check what happened next some believe that if the united states continues down this path the result will inevitably be a severe crisis in the years to come and the solution for that might rest on going back to the gold standard but for some things are not as simple as gold standard defenders believe no one disagrees that the u s fiscal situation is challenging but having the currency tied to gold would change some of the most basic fundamentals of the current monetary policy in the ongoing system the federal reserve can respond to financial crises in many ways among many measures it can lower interest rates during a recession raise the rates during an inflationary period or it can buy or sell government bonds and inject money into the economy when necessary and this flexibility to act according to the situation was very important in the last decade during the financial crash or covet crisis the fed has resorted to expansionary measures in both cases if the currency were still pegged to gold the fed's actions would be limited and one can only imagine both the social and economic impacts that might have incurred on the gold standard system the focus of any monetary policy would be diverted away from ensuring economic stability to maintaining an exchange rate target with gold being the most important aspect of the economy the country's need to keep its reserves intact becomes the focal point of the central banks more than providing an ideal business scenario fighting unemployment or raising productivity also making exchange rate adjustments would be more difficult and the government would have to resort to alternatives like protectionist measures higher tariffs import quotas or exchange control the results of this could harm economies around the world and affect global trade another negative aspect of the gold standard that is not very often discussed would be environmental damage gold is a scarce mineral increased demand for gold would mean that mining activity would also increase very often on indigenous lands around the world the impacts of this could be devastating okay back to the question of how the economy would look like when we still have the dollar pegged to gold three economists have a possible answer to this question through a quantitative method they calculate how the u s economy would have performed if the dollar was still pegged to the gold between two thousand and twenty twenty the results are not very good for the gold standard advocates for example the researchers found that the shocks on gold supply and demand would have a greater negative effect on the economy than any other shocks that have happened such as an economic crisis if the gold standard was still in place during this period we would have an increase in economic volatilities and a deterioration of the household welfare basically the speed at which gold is mined introduces a lot of randomness to monetary policy the fed would have to set interest rates to maintain a fixed dollar price of gold rather than to target inflation as it is today for example in moments of crisis people spend less and investors purchase more gold a safe haven investment in this case the central bank would have to increase the interest rate to make other assets more attractive and control the price of the mineral if the reverse happens and for some reason there is more gold in the world the central bank would have to lower the interest rate in the end the monetary decision would not be rational or based on facts and estimations but more a matter of faith or a belief on what could happen to the gold situation in the world in summary an economy based on how much gold is mined around the world would be let's say probably more unstable but is it even reasonable to consider a transition back to gold standard well it depends who you ask for some it would be a big mess but not impossible for starters the united states would not be able to go back to the gold standard alone due to trade and money supply it would be very complicated for the us to do this alone otherwise countries that own large chunks of u s debt like china for example could just ask for their dollars to be exchanged for gold in theory that would not be a problem but and that's a big but if every debt holder does the same the us probably won't have enough gold in its reserve to pay it all back yes the numbers don't match so if it wants to go down this path the us would have to pump its gold reserves or the gold price would have to be set so high and the dollar would be so devalued that inflation would follow and trade would possibly crash that's the scenario that critics of the gold standard believed to happen if an attempt to go back would take place but defenders do not agree with that in the end the gold standard is not as unusual as some people want to believe it's just a fixed valued system according to the imf many countries around the world have their currencies somehow linked to an external standard typically the euro or the dollar for a country going back to the gold standard would be more of the same and not that crazy and if these views were once restricted to the fringes it really made it to the mainstream in the last years the republican party called for a commission to investigate the viability of going back to the gold standard on the campaign platforms of and a bill to establish a commission to look into the feasibility of the gold standard was approved in the house of representatives in and but never managed to get approved in the senate alexander mooney a representative from west virginia even proposed the full on return to the gold standard on a bill that never got co sponsors and never happened in when then president donald trump appointed judy shelton a longtime gold standard advocate to a seat on the federal reserve's board of governors everyone thought that shelton would finally get to the front seat of monetary policy makers the nomination got stuck in the senate and never happened but shelton's ideas were put under the spotlight in the past she had called for a new bretton woods conference referencing the meeting that established the post war economic order to understand exactly what a new bretton woods would mean today we need to go back in time and look into the origins of the first one the road to breton woods was paved by policies and choices from way before the conference in the gold standard act made the policy official in the united states the gold dollar was then declared the standard unit and all forms of money issued by the government were to be maintained at parity with it after the first world war countries started experimenting leaving the gold standard and printing more money to save their economies the united states kept the gold standard after the crash of investors started trading commodities in currencies looking for safer investments and the price of gold rose a hoarding phenomenon spread in the united states affecting the country's gold reserves in u s president franklin delano roosevelt issued an executive order for bidding hoarding and the gold reserve act was signed in with the forbidding people were allowed to keep just the equivalent of one hundred dollars and everything else needed to be returned to the state the gold reserve act would lead to the creation of the reserves at fort knox in the legendary u s gold depository in kentucky where million ounces of gold are kept at the moment fast forward to the last year of the second world war representatives of countries gathered in july in breton woods a resort place in new hampshire to organize what would be the post war monetary system it was also in the same event that the ideas of the international monetary fund and the world bank initially focused only on reconstruction were forged the americans arrived at bretton woods in a very strong position with reserves of metric tons of gold roughly percent of the world's total they advocated for fixed conversion rates assured by a dollar tied to gold the brits heavily in debt and broke after the war were hoping for flexible exchange rates to revive exports but the americans feared post war inflation in the end the americans had their way after the agreement the countries were to keep their currencies fixed but adjustable to the dollar which was pegged to gold at an ounce it was only by however that the system started operating as agreed in bretton woods up to this point countries maintained fixed exchange rates in relation to the dollar by buying their currency in exchange markets when too low or increasing the supply of money when too high during the sixties a surplus of dollars caused by foreign aid military spending due to the vietnam war and foreign investment made it almost impossible for the united states to keep the value of the gold at presidents tried to control the gold price with actions like restrictions on foreign lending this resulted in the nation's foreign trading position being damaged for the overvalued dollar in then president richard nixon announced that the united states would no longer buy gold to maintain the price at thirty five dollars and halted the convertibility which meant that countries could no longer redeem dollars""]"

changes the inflation reduction act has passed the senate and house and was signed into law by the president although this act has several focuses regarding health care costs and taxation the most impactful for medicare beneficiaries is the prescription drug price reform the ira legislation aims to make prescription drugs more affordable to the nearly million medicare part d beneficiaries in the country the legislation includes provisions that will cap costs on party plans allow negotiated prices for expensive meds provide coverage on part d vaccines and more hi i am danielle roberts co founder of boomer benefits and author of the best selling book costly medicare mistakes you can't afford to make in this video i will dive into everything you need to know about the inflation reduction act and its impact on medicare beneficiaries be sure to hit that subscribe button to stay up to date with all medicare changes in the years to come music next year beneficiaries will begin to feel the impact of the approved legislation first up is the cap on monthly insulin costs for medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in the senior savings program was rolled out and prohibited participating drug plans from charging more than a copay for specific insulins listed on their formularies however not all plans were required to comply with this new inflation reduction act all part d and medicare advantage plans with drug coverage must cap covered insulin at dollars per month starting in january this includes self injected insulin and insulin used with a pump our free medicare q a group on facebook gets hundreds of monthly questions about medicare coverage for vaccines and some vaccines covered by part d were still costly for many beneficiaries the ira requires that part d plans must now cover many of the vaccines that seniors need in full at percent though medicare part b covers some vaccinations at such as pneumonia flu covid and hepatitis b some other necessary vaccines fall under part d coverage one part d vaccine in particular the shingles vaccine has been a costly and unwelcome surprise to beneficiaries who's sometimes paid for the vaccine in full due to their part d deductible under the new legislation the shingles vaccine must be covered in full bipart d plans without cost sharing of the application of their deductible it's great news that this vaccine will no longer have surprise out of pocket costs for medicare beneficiaries many people have expressed concern about the pharmaceutical companies raising the cost of certain drugs to make up for losses on other drugs however the legislation addressed this potential loophole as well beginning in if a drug manufacturer increases its drugs faster than the inflation rate it will have to pay rebates to avoid penalties music in part d's catastrophic coverage stage is getting a makeover if you are familiar with the structure of part d plans you know that there are four stages to all part d plans the fourth and final stage is the catastrophic coverage stage which comes after the coverage gap or donut hole in the catastrophic stage the beneficiary pays five percent of the cost of their drugs for the remainder of the calendar year after paying cost sharing in the coverage gap beneficiaries are often relieved to reach the catastrophic stage and pay only five percent however paying even five percent of the cost of medications with no cap can still result in high annual costs for medicare beneficiaries especially those people on expensive brand name meds in that five percent cost sharing is gone for good the elimination of this cost sharing means that once you exit the donut hole you no longer have any out of pocket costs to worry about with your part d plan the initial coverage stage and the donut hole will remain the same nonetheless this will provide significant relief for part d enrollees who find it challenging to pay for their necessary medications during the catastrophic coverage stage you are probably wondering if this will skyrocket your medicare part d premiums fortunately in the same cost cutting vein medicare's part d plans will have a cap on premium increases beginning in from to medicare part d premiums cannot increase more than six percent annually this change allows more control over premiums and protects the medicare beneficiaries from over inflated premiums from the carriers the final change that you can expect in is an expansion of the low income subsidy program many people know this program as extra help today eligibility for this program starts when income is at percent of the federal poverty level but will change to begin at percent in i am particularly happy about this one because we've seen so many people over the years who are very close to qualifying for that extra help but missed it when their income was just slightly over the limit qualifying for the subsidy eliminates the deductible and provides lower co pays making it more affordable for low income beneficiaries for their necessary outpatient medications foreign developments in the ira is the two thousand dollar part d cost cap capping out of pocket prescription costs has been a topic of conversation for years this change will essentially stop the money bleeding when you're out of pocket costs on cover prescription drugs at hit starting in the cap will spread throughout the year and essentially eliminate the donut hole stage once and for all the change also allows seniors to spread the burden of the cost throughout the calendar year however please note that there will be no change or impact on the initial coverage stage where you pay reasonable co pays for your medications foreign beginning in the federal government will be able to negotiate the cost of certain high priced single sourced and biological drugs under this new negotiation program the hhs will publish a list of drugs that are eligible for negotiation and the list will include part d and part b drugs with the highest total expenditures in the most recent month period negotiated prices must take effect for eligible drugs in and increased to drugs in although beneficiaries won't see the negotiated prices until the government will be taking a significant step in creating more affordable drug prices for seniors which should ultimately benefit all medicare beneficiaries in the long run though controversial in many ways there is no question that the inflation reduction act will provide much needed relief for many seniors regarding the high cost of prescription drugs medicare

""this big mac meal here in turkey costs turkish lira that's about at today's exchange rate pretty reasonable for mcdonald's but consider this if you're earning minimum wage here this meal is going to cost you the equivalent of working more than three hours but that's just mcdonald's what about other things like everyday items how many hours of work does it take to afford those one hour an hour and a half two hours two and a half hours three hours five hours one day one day and a half one week three weeks two months nine months and if you want to be able to afford this car working minimum wage here that will take you years it's actually getting worse and worse turkey's currency is falling drastically but buying power is going down also decreasing inflation is soaring the currency is getting higher higher higher all this means daily life is becoming harder and harder my money doesn't have any value and it's people especially young generation are frustrated it's so hard to be a young people this is literally the worst time to be young person in turkey it's hard to live here as a young person this is a story about so much more than mcdonald's or even economics it's about how people are struggling to make ends meet as their buying power falls and its young generation dreams of a life abroad money is worthless and life in turkey is worthless it's so hard to live in turkey actually that's batikan he was working at a jewelry store when i met him just six months ago he was earning per day last year i earn money for a day but this year but today he's now earning less than a day so many young people has no money they can't drink something they can't eat some to get out of sight it's so hard for them six years ago if you had turkish lira you could exchange that for but now if you wanted you would need to fork over turkish lira for the same amount the currency has plunged more than this year but even before this year things were not good since or so the currency's just gone up i mean it just keeps on going up so it happened like five years ago where one day it just got to eight i think not even ten but eight and that day the politicians were speaking about something so that's why it got that high president erdogan and the turkish government i have a message release pastor andrew brunson now or be prepared to face the consequences she's referring to a moment when the turkish lira dropped the most it had in nearly years because of tension between president trump and turkey's president turkish prison to the white house in hours that's not bad i really can't forget that day because at the time the dollar just like increased a lot and my dad told me that like we can't afford your college tuition anymore since then the currency began falling as investors globally questioned the country's stability as the turkish lira becomes weaker and weaker more people are looking to buy grown products instead of importing from other countries that's just one way to keep prices stable and home grown bananas are just one example so even though i paid twice as much for these bananas they're actually clearly not as fresh because they were imported from costa rica but i am curious to see which one tastes better the ones that are from turkey or the ones that are imported i honestly didn't think that turkey had the climate to even grow bananas so the fact that they're selling home grown bananas is quite interesting let's give it a try this definitely tastes different but i guess some people if they can afford it or willing to pay for the imported bananas amidst the currency crisis inflation here is surging hitting which makes everyday prices a lot more expensive remember earlier in the grocery store imagine working two weeks of your life just to be able to afford this the thing is that the basic things such as cheese breads maybe it's actually got twice off the price of the basic things which you can roll on your life got higher transportation prices are getting higher for the people who live just everyday life they're ruining their life even more one lira means nothing in turkey now but pastimes it had a lot of value like you can buy some stuff with one there but now it's nothing they can't buy anything they can't buy any of the houses you know the rents prices are also getting higher and higher it was turkish lira per month this year it was four or so why exactly is all this happening turkey's economy is actually growing by a whopping at one point this year making it the biggest growth compared to any other major country except for china this happen especially as many of its covid restrictions were lifted but if the economy is growing then what exactly is the problem well you can call that partially as some economists say an exchange rate illusion in terms of gdp per capita turkey has dropped over the past eight years during covid its government was helping a lot of businesses and citizens pumping a lot more money into the economy this is partially why its currency is weakening and inflation is soaring turkey has a big economy it's the th largest economy in the world but when you divide that by its massive population size it becomes number see usually to slow down inflation economists say you should raise interest rates you know to keep the amount of money limited but despite what's happening turkey's central bank's most recent move was to cut interest rates hoping to encourage investment i think it's because of the politics right now everybody is just thinking about money nowadays but if it changes it has to be like that politics should change and after that money would change and after that everybody will get better turkey's president has fired the head of its central bank multiple times in just a few years there have been four governors now raising concern about any sustainable plan surely because of the decisions of the government i'm not talking about the country i'm talking about the specific way governments people who runs the country are deciding their decisions upon their daily decisions all these money issues are impacting jobs my friends who's an interior architect and now they're working at cafes then i have one of them ask me for a job from my dad the job owners are paying little money for students because like for an hour some i know some guys they earn nine or ten turkish lira it's actually nothing at the time of making this video that's equal to less than a day let's say i wanted to have my own place by now but there's no way that i can afford it now most students can't go out mostly young people stay at home and doing some jobs or works but they can't go out i mean all of my friends and i are just like looking for jobs that pay in dollars because that's the only way to just survive here owning a car here has become near impossible as turkey's government imposes high taxes on importing cars in fact these taxes make turkey one of the most expensive places to own a car can't buy the new cars are starting from turkish lira it's so much money and it's impossible to buy a car things are similar for apple product where turkey has imposed a nearly tax on apple products apple is crazy and shaky because like i got this phone from new york about like lira but if i happen to get this phone in turkey it will cost me about like lira so what's next for turkey i want to go abroad but my money is getting lower my savings are getting lower and lower and actually i don't know what can i do i might think to go to the u s again because everything's so expensive and when you just even we earn dollars and euros it doesn't mean anything like you spend so much money for everything our school is right there and it's called the german school so we are going to germany hopefully getting out of our country to study in germany i think i'm going to put my life in germany i want that the government will be changed but i'm not sure about that still and they don't know how to pull gen z into their side so i think they will be going off in a lot of times as we talk you're laughing you know this is i mean this is it seems like it would be stressful it's money like what can i leave everyday in turkey you can't always the excuse that you can't always be moody you have to be happy because you can't sleep are you worried the currency will get even worse no i don't think so and that is the worst times but we will get used to it it never gets better people just get use like we just live like that"", ""gong reverberating narrator why has the cost of balloons risen in the past years because of inflation inflation is a dangerous and sometimes fatal disease for a society a classic example is the extreme case of germany austria and russia after the first world war when the inflation reached levels at which employers would pay their workers three times a day after breakfast lunch and dinner so they could go out and spend the money before it lost all its value but you don't have to go to such extremes to see the harm which inflation left unchecked can do we need to ask ourselves what is the cause of this disease called inflation how do you cure the disease what are the effects and side effects of the cure and what will happen if we don't cure it the first step to understand the cause of inflation is to recognize that it is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon it's always and everywhere a result of too much money of a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output we must also recognize that today governments control the quantity of money and as a result inflation in the united states is created in washington and nowhere else government just like any of us doesn't want to take responsibility for bad things if something bad happens it wasn't our fault politicians often say that inflation is produced by greedy businessmen or by unions or by spendthrift consumers or maybe it's those terrible middle eastern countries that produce it yes businessmen are greedy trade unions are grasping and of course the consumer is a spendthrift but who of us isn't all those things the trick is that none of them can produce inflation since none of them can print money only washington has the printing press and therefore only washington can produce inflation communists might tell you that inflation is a capitalist phenomenon that is not true if you look at cuba today which is a communist country it has an inflation rate closer to one of the slowest rates of inflation has been in switzerland which is a capitalist country so inflation is not a capitalist or a communist phenomenon it is a printing press phenomenon this has been documented over and over again there is evidence for united states for years great britain for years sweden for years you might also hear the trade unions cause inflation by pushing up the wages but what about countries like venezuela that has the highest inflation rate in the world at the moment but has an authoritarian regime where trade unions don't have any power we must ask why is it that the quantity of money increases relative to output sometimes it increases because of discoveries of gold and precious metals the gold rush in california and the australian gold discoveries in the late s and early s caused a worldwide inflation as a result we also had a worldwide inflation because of the perfection of the cyanide process of extracting gold but those were the old good days now governments figured out a better way of controlling the quantity of money by ending the link to gold and instead turning to government dominated money so today you won't get an inflation for those reasons today you have inflation because governments create a very large quantity of money the question is why the first and most important reason is government spending first we ask congress to spend more money on us and then we ask them to tax us less you can't do one without the other if the federal government spends trillion and raises only trillion in taxes who do you suppose pays the other trillion santa claus you paid and i paid and one of the ways we paid is by tax called inflation inflation is a form of taxation when government spends more than it takes in taxes it meets the difference by printing more money printing money is very attractive for a politician who is trying to meet the demands for his or her re election it is really taxation without representation government has two other ways of getting revenue other than printing money with the tax system that we have in place let's say the prices go up and your income goes up you think you're in the same position but you are not you are pushed to a higher bracket of income and on average in a situation when price and income both go up your taxes will go up so in fact politicians are again in a marvelous position where they vote to lower taxes when in fact taxes are going up all of these tax cuts you hear about on tv are not tax cuts at all inflation has raised taxes and so called tax cuts have given back a small part of that to the taxpayer but the actual taxes to be paid have gone up because of inflation in the third place government gets revenue from inflation by canceling out its debt government debt is not something to be worried about in fact anybody who has bought a longterm government bond and then redeemed it has gotten back an amount of money which has less purchasing power less ability to buy goods and services than the sum he initially paid for the bond and to add insult to injury he has to pay taxes on what they call interest and as a result the debt has gone down in meaningful terms so inflation is a marvelous resource for a government in all three of these ways that has been the main reason throughout history and not only now but going back for thousands of years there was a great inflation during the time of the roman empire when they acquisition was an emperor he did it by taking full bodied silver coins and replacing them by an alloy that was worthless until there was less and less silver until he became a copper coin with a wash of silver the american treasury was replacing our full bodied silver coin by a copper coin with not even a wash of silver only a nickel history does repeat itself another less important factor are the mistaken policies by the federal reserve first it was at fault for producing the depression during the s by reducing the quantity of money in the us by a third and today it is making a mistake in the opposite direction their mistake has almost always been caused by confusing their function by thinking that they had something to do with the interest rates instead of recognizing that their real function is to control the quantity of money you might say what about international influences we get the inflation from abroad and government is quick to blame other countries that might have been a valid explanation before when we had a worldwide system of fixed exchange rates in that case it is true that inflation in one country would tend to spill over into another but today countries have variable exchange rates between their currencies that update and adjust every second and as long as that is true inflation is a national phenomenon and not an international phenomenon just like every country that has high taxes but high taxes is not an international phenomenon it is just that many countries do it at the same time same way with inflation if it was an international phenomenon how comes switzerland has an inflation rate less than ukraine has closer to and venezuela has the cure to inflation is very simple in order to stop inflation you have to have the government spend less and print less that's the only way we're going to stop inflation but you know the real problem is not how to cure inflation the real problem is to have the political will to do so every smoker knows that smoking is bad yet they continue to do it alcoholism is another great analogy for inflation when you are out drinking the good effects come first and the bad effects come on the next day with a hangover same happens when the governments print money everyone thinks they are richer it makes business good expense output it is only after a while that inflation happens similarly when trying to cure an alcoholic the bad effects come first and good effects come later it is exactly the same with inflation just as inflating stimulates the economy temporarily slowing down inflation slows down the economy temporarily another reason why it's hard to cure inflation is because it's not clear if people want to do it everyone complains about inflation but many people also benefit if you bought a house in the past years you were able to borrow on a mortgage which inflation has paid off almost all homeowners have benefited one of the biggest reasons why inflation is such a bad social disease is precisely that it tends to be divisive some people do really well and some people do very badly let's emphasize that bad effects are not themselves the cure of inflation they are side effects of the cure and in the same way unemployment is not a cure for inflation but it is almost an inevitable side effect of an effective cure now we should ask why is it that there seems to be no way to cure inflation without going through a period of a relative slow growth and relatively high unemployment the answer are the time delays between printing money and the ultimate effects on output and prices suppose the government prints money and spends it to pay for its expenses in the beginning the people who find themselves doing better business don't know what the explanation is government is paying more money its employees have better salaries they are coming and buying more goods the storekeeper is happy to sell them at the same price as before each person thinks there is something special happening to them the clothing manufacturer thinks that the demand for clothing is going up it doesn't recognize that the demand is going up everywhere and not only for clothing and that is going to have to pay more to get labor more to get raw materials and for general production after a while he finds out that the costs are up and he's forced into raising the prices this is why on average an increase in the quantity of money takes five or six months to affect people's spending first people just start having bigger bank accounts it takes them some time to realize that and start spending the money it takes another to months before that shows up in the prices so on average over the past years in the united states and years in britain there has been a two year interval between a more rapid increase in the quantity of money on the one hand and the inflationary effects on the other if the government slows down its spending people experience a slower demand for their products and they tend to cut back on production it is only after a considerable interval that it is reflected in lower prices or in a slower rate of increase in prices so there is no way that we know of to avoid the interim effect of slowing down inflation another resemblance between inflation and alcoholism is that when a fellow first gets started on drinking all it takes is one drink to make him happy but after his buddy gets adjusted it takes bigger and bigger doses likewise as a country gets accustomed to higher and higher inflation it needs a bigger dose to have any stimulating effect there is no way to avoid bad side effects but they can be minimized by taking the cure gradually other than cutting government spending and stopping the printing press we can minimize the side effects of inflation by adopting the widespread government program with respect to taxes it is a disgrace and a scandal that we have not had legislation which has adjusted the income tax system so that inflation doesn't automatically raise rates congress has been very quick to index its own salaries and salaries of government employees but it has been very reluctant to apply the same principle to the taxes that it imposes on the citizen instead we should go the other way we should index congress and government official salaries perversely every inflation is a reduction in their salaries and i assure you we would cure inflation really fast but what if we don't cure inflation we have no good choices we will also have high unemployment one of the main reasons is because of the false cures that will be attempted in every country that had great inflation the governments have resorted sooner or later to wage and price controls supposedly as an attempt to cure inflation united states did that in with disastrous results in fact they are imposed by governments that want to inflate but wants to conceal it from the people the inflation in the united states really started in the early s when john f kennedy became a president from we have been on a rollercoaster we have been going up in inflation and coming down every time we go up there is a great outcry that we have to do something about stopping inflation and so we tend to step on the brakes that tends to produce a recession but when unemployment starts going up there is an even bigger outcry we have to do something about the unemployment so we step on the accelerator instead of the brakes and we're off again the problem is that each peak of inflation has been higher than the previous peak each bottom has been higher than the previous one just like an alcoholic who need higher doses to feel stimulation the tragedy of this whole history is that we have time and time paid for the price of stopping and inflation and not gotten the benefit we step on the brakes we've taken a recession we've had high unemployment and then just as inflation was starting to taper we started printing money again unfortunately given the amount of money that has been pumped into the economy we have only two bad choices if we slow down drastically in order to try to hold back inflation the economy will experience a recession and it may be a fairly severe recession alternatively you can say well we can do that we've got to step on the gas keep doing what we're doing now then you are condemning the economy to go into another period of double digit inflation it must be said that the congressmen are not at fault for this it is us the american people who are not telling the government what we want to do and when we decide that we want to stop the rollercoaster there will be no technical difficulty in doing so let's emphasize it will not be costless to stop it but it will not be costless to continue what we are doing now we have a disease called inflation fortunately our basic constitution is strong and we're a strong healthy country although we have been doing our best to make it unhealthy we have been doing our best to take measures that will reduce our productivity sooner or later i am sure we will get to cure inflation but until then we will be paying the price either way i hope you're having a nice day feel free to

makes every woman go out and every man go so what is inflation and why do people keep talking about it here's some cute bunnies to break it down for you inflation is when a carrot that used to cost one dollar now costs five dollars is when prices are going up it can be because growing carrots is becoming expensive for the farmer so bunnies have to pay the extra cost it can be because governments and banks are printing more banknotes which makes the value of money go down it can be because raccoons and hamsters decide to buy carrots too more people want to buy the same carrots which makes them more valuable and the price goes up basically inflation defines how much money is worth but depending on how high or low it is it can make the same hundred dollar bill buy your yacht a house a pencil or a carrot"", ""hey everyone and welcome back to our channel we are absolutely blown away at the recent support of the channel we're really close to subscribers so if you want to be the th sub the button is all yours for the clicking today we're going to be looking at a topic that's really been making headlines lately and that's inflation currently the inflation rate in canada is reaching numbers we haven't seen in over years since early while a portion of high inflation can be attributed to global shortages in supply in this video we're going to look at the implications of printing money and answer the question why does printing more money lead to high levels of inflation with that said let's get right into things have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but i think it's one of those questions people might be a bit too embarrassed to ask and there's definitely no shortage of people wondering the answer is inflation inflation is defined as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money and resulting in the loss of value of currency so first let's determine what exactly money or currency is now this may seem obvious but something that's important to know is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means is that money itself has no actual value it's only considered valuable because it can buy things if you watched our last video you would know this as the term fiat money an easy way to wrap your head around fiat money having no value outside of the value the government assigns for it is to think if you were stranded on a desert island money would be completely useless money has been around for thousands of years however when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money again if you need a reminder of what this is feel free to check out our previous video things were traded that had actual value and uses like salt spices horses or weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to their rarity or scarcity are almost universally accepted as currency we slowly phased out of using commodity money as it became difficult for you to store your wealth you'd have to carry it around with you all the time then we came up with something called representative money since carrying everything around all the time can be difficult representative money made more sense basically you give your gold to the bank and the bank keeps it safe for you and in return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own the gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go to redeem them for gold at any time these have evolved over time to the bank notes which we now refer to as dollar bills these dollar bills are fiat money today almost every country in the world uses fiat money so basic economics tells us that the more money in the economy the lower the value of each dollar this is due to money becoming less scarce money is now easier to come by and since there's more of it in the economy the prices of goods and services must also increase to catch up to this increase in money supply let's look at an example if everyone in canada woke up and saw that the bank of canada had given one million dollars to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a new lamborghini we would eventually run out of lamborghinis but do you see the issue here the value of money is so deflated that people have too much of it there's only a finite number of lamborghinis available in the country do we see the problem here let's use a different analogy to demonstrate this imagine there's four people on a desert island and each of them have pieces of various fruits and all the fruits are considered absolutely equal in value now imagine they discover an entire forest of apple trees on the island the nominal value of apples has increased because there's more apples on the island but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply nobody really wants to trade for apples anymore since they can just go to this apple forest and get some themselves therefore it now cost apples to trade for one banana since the demand for apples is now low but the demand for bananas is still high just to clarify in this analogy the people represent different countries the fruits their respective currencies and the apple forest is all that extra printed money so to summarize what we've been saying increasing the supply of money unambiguously decreases its value as it's much more readily available and easier to obtain therefore less scarce this creates inflation as prices of goods and services must increase to keep up with the current amount of money in circulation you can run into some serious issues however when inflation or the increase in the price of goods and services exceeds the rate at which people earn money which in turn creates prices of necessities that are too expensive for people to pay and the cost of living being unaffordable but more on that in a future video if you're still here we really hope you enjoyed the
