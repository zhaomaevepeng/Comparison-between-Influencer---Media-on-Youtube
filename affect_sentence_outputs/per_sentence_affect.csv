nKTwz9mdsFw,1.0,0,hey everyone kieran king here today i'm going to be talking about the inverse relationship between inflation and interest rates inflation seems to be a hot topic with many nations seeing greater inflation than usual why well the main reason is of course due to the global pandemic over the last two years and the subsequent supply chain problems that have arisen causing a spike in demand and price increases everywhere to fight rapid inflation certain governments around the world have increased interest rates for instance the bank of england in the uk increased interest rates only recently from 0.1 to 0.25 but what is the theory behind this this is what we're going to look at in this video firstly what is inflation inflation generally speaking is the weakening of a currency and the subsequent increase in the prices of everyday goods and services for instance the price of bread in the uk in 1975 was 16p in 2021 it is around 106 p as prices rise this means that the currency's purchasing power decreases using the same example 160 nowadays could buy you six and a half loaves of bread back in 1975. the rate of inflation can be measured using something called a consumer price index or cpi which i have done in a separate video on if you're interested now typically you don't want inflation to be too high as it will be difficult for businesses to set the right prices for their products and for people to plan their spending on the other hand if it is too low then people might not spend as much as they expect prices to fall which stops the economy growing let's move on to interest rates what are interest rates interest rates tell you what the cost of borrowing is or what the rewards are for saving if you get a loan for say a thousand pound from the bank at a one percent interest rate it means the total amount you're gonna have to repay is one thousand and ten pounds an extra one percent on top of what you borrowed on the flip side if you put a thousand pound away to save a one percent interest rate it means you will earn ten pound after a year so will have with one thousand and ten pounds when we talk about interest rates in the news this usually means the base rate which the bank of england over here in the uk sets this has a heavy influence on the rates you get from high street banks and other institutions to borrow and save so back to the initial question how does inflation and interest rates work together well what is the relationship between them let's give an example say interest rates are lower than usual this encourages people to borrow more and save less as rates are low it is cheap to borrow but less rewarding to save as a result what do people do people they tend to spend more when interest rates are low they consume more they go out for dinner they buy cars on finance they have holidays and so on in the big picture there is a greater demand for goods and services so the demand becomes stronger when compared to the supply greater demand to supply of these goods and services means those goods and services can afford to increase their prices and an increase in prices as you know increase the rate of inflation let's now let's look at the opposite what if there are higher interest rates than usual well the opposite happens higher rates encourage people to save more and borrow less it is expensive to borrow but rewarding to save and put money away as a result that's what people do they don't go out as much they don't have lots of holidays and instead put their money away for a rainy day this initiates lesser demand to supply of general goods and services this means that those goods and services need to decrease their prices leading to decreased inflation or perhaps even deflation now this is just the theory and there are a lot of things that influence the inflation rate and not just the current interest rate looking back over history however we do tend to see this relationship justified anyway do you think it's justified let me know in the comments as always thank you for your continued support if you do like my content then please hit the subscribe button and give me a like also if you have any ideas for other videos then feel free to message me and i'll try and add them to the list take care everyone and i'll see you all soon [Music],0.036,0.765,0.198,0.9994,0.15217391304347827,0.11956521739130435,0.021739130434782608,0.18478260869565216,0.13043478260869565,0.06521739130434782,0.043478260869565216,0.2826086956521739,0.9006643378895779,0.824905482041588

big news bank is judging that the only way they can try to pull down inflation is to carry on raising interest rates we're going to see rising rates rising interest rates that will make the cost to borrowing go up it can send ripples across the whole economy it can sink consumer confidence result in fewer jobs and lower wages and cause stock prices to fall if they go too far too fast it can tip economies into recession so why do central banks raise interest rates [Music] let's start with the basics if you borrow money you'll have to pay back a little extra to make it worthwhile for the lender well i think we can make you this long you have a good reputation we know you're reliable i'm glad you think so this is the interest rate so if you are taking out a loan you want the interest rate to be as low as possible so you don't have to pay that much back on the flip side if you want to save money then a high interest rate means you can earn more on your savings see it as a reward for leaving money in your account but the size of your reward depends on the circumstances there's no single interest rate in the economy you've got thousands of banks setting their own commercial rates that's all influenced though by the interest rate that the central bank sets a central bank is like a bank for banks just like you and your savings account banks also earn interest when they leave money with a central bank commercial banks have these things called reserves so that's a bit like their cash on hand commercial banks lend those excess reserves to each other at an interest rate and they also can deposit their excess reserves at the central bank and when they do that they can earn an interest rate ordinary people can't access the interest rate on the excess reserves but it still affects them and that's the idea when central banks raise interest rates they're trying to control inflation how fast prices rise for everyone they were 129 now they won 39 and last in the space of four weeks central banks like the fed or the bank of england or the european central bank are all trying to hit an inflation target of two percent interest rates are a really powerful tool that they have to do that if inflation is seen as too high that's when banks raise interest rates the change spreads through the financial system and slows down the rate of inflation here's how a rise in interest rates from a central bank means that a commercial bank will earn more on their reserves they might make more from keeping their money in a central bank then lending it out so if they do lend it out they'll raise their interest rates to make it worth their while how that affects consumers depends on the economy take mortgages in places like finland or australia lots of people have mortgages with variable interest rates if you've got a variable rate mortgage where the interest rate that you pay is linked to the central bank's interest rate then higher interest rates mean that essentially immediately the higher rate will translate into less cash to spend on other things less spare cash means households will spend less and less spending means businesses will be warier of raising prices this should lower inflation in other countries like america or canada a bigger share of mortgages are set at fixed rates people with fixed rates are protected against the direct effects of an interest rate rise but will still feel an indirect impact higher interest rates mean that mortgages will become more expensive if that is affecting all new buyers then house prices will begin to fall and that will make everyone who owns a home feel poorer and therefore they might spend less lower spending will translate into lower inflation and it's not just consumers who will tighten the purse strings when interest rates rise then businesses will find it more expensive to borrow and invest that generally means less economic activity it might mean fewer jobs are created fewer jobs and lower wages could mean less money for households and consumer confidence might suffer which also means less spending people are grappling with a decline in real wages meaning their money buys less when interest rates rise that will tend to slow down spending investment and generally depress economic activity overall that will make businesses more reluctant to raise their prices and that will tend to pull back inflation it sounds straightforward right but the trick is judging how far to go in 1981 the federal reserve america's central bank allowed interest rates to rise to a whopping 19

KZJm-Bt4rSs,1.0,0,so right now if you got bruce bruce is a guy who wears sunglasses that's just who he is man okay have you got bruce over there right now he is freaking out about inflation because his wallet is empty and so bruce is going to be living a life with his hands up to the sky wondering what the heck happened and that is exactly why bruce is saying let's go brandon alrighty folks today we are going to explain why inflation is out of control here in the united states we're going to break it down along three axes we're going to talk about supply chain problems we're going to talk about government spending and we're going to talk about monetary inflation via the federal reserve this video is brought to you by our friends over at birch gold by the way this video is a pretty good reason why you might want to invest at least a little bit into precious metals okay so why don't we begin with joe biden's big excuse that is the supply chain when the pandemic happened factories everywhere shut down it is much easier to shut down a factory as it turns out than to spin it back up and the supply chains across the world are extraordinarily integrated in a way that they weren't for most of human history so for example according to some surveys in 2019 nearly 100 of major companies said that they had some part of their supply chain located in china well china had all of these jobs shipped over there right all the way over here because they have very few labor regulations because they have slave labor in some cases they have no environmental regulation so if you're going to create dye for example and then just dump the toxic waste into a river you ain't going to do that in europe you're not going to do that in the united states wealthy nations can afford to care about the environment china doesn't care so china just pollutes up the wazoo that means that if you're going to produce a manufactured good then you are generally going to be doing that in china if you're going to be doing innovation if you're going to be doing service industry stuff you're going to be doing that in the west and as the supply chain starts to become longer and longer in order to account for the differences between labor supplies and different countries you start to see massive integration between countries well when something shuts down in china that means that it's going to have an impact on whatever is the next factory that requires the input there's a very famous essay called i pencil came out in 1985 all about how a pencil is created they take the most simple object that you know of and think about how many different countries this thing has had to go through in order to get to you when you have a pencil you have the little eraser where's the rubber come from you have a little metal piece where does that come from you have the wood where is that coming from you have the paint on the outside where's that coming from you got the lead where's that coming from we'll now take complex product like a car and you're talking about maybe half a dozen or a dozen countries that the various parts have to come from in order to manufacture that well you shut down not one factory but many factories all at the same time because of covid it's gonna be very difficult to spin that back up so you're gonna see a real shock in terms of the supply that is available to deal with the demand now when the pandemic hit what people were mostly concerned about is that demand would completely disappear and you get a worldwide depression because people just would not buy anything ever again nobody had a job nobody had any money nobody knew exactly what to do and nothing like this had really happened in modern history before certainly not on a global scale the way that this did and you combine that with the long tail of regulations that have existed in the west with for example the port so in the united states the unions in the united states have bargained particularly on the west coast to shut down the ports for certain numbers of hours per day you have real problems with how containers fit on ships and what sort of containers fit on trucks and what happens if they can't fit into the ports properly and so what you end up with is at every place in the supply chain real delays let's say that you have a factory in china and it is manufacturing a product and it has to make its way around over to india where it's used as an input and now it's going to get shipped to brazil for another input and then that is going to get shipped over to say the east coast of the united states where it then has to travel across the country if at every point here you have a delay you're going to end up with a really really big delay one of the big shortages that's occurred here is in semiconductors because it's difficult to produce semiconductors because the technological innovation that is associated with semiconductors is largely in eastern asia and 92 of all advanced semiconductors are produced in taiwan another six percent are produced over in in south korea and when you have a shortage in semiconductors that means that new cars become incredibly expensive this is why no one can get a new car now this is why used cars are pricing above new cars so the problems of supply chains are very very real and they're not is of course very silly to also pretend as joe biden did that he can just get the ports working 24 hours a day and that fixes it obviously is not going to do it but if this were just a supply chain issue then again it would apply to europe the same as it's applying to the united states and it doesn't which brings us to issue number two how the united states decided to spend during this pandemic and the answer is we spent more money than anyone has ever seen in the history of humanity if you draw a chart of the national debt of the united states here is what it's going to look like okay then 2021 happens the pandemic and our national debt is now off the chart it's gone okay so in the past year and a half we had about seven trillion dollars to the national debt from 2020 to 2021 we added seven trillion dollars to the national debt we spent more money than has ever been seen by god or man the idea was that the federal government was going to pay everybody to stay home they were going to pay them hundreds of dollars per week to stay home that lasted all the way from march 2020 all the way until september of 2021 these extended unemployment benefits for example what did this do they told people why don't you stay home people did people who were working took the money and they pocketed it by the end of the pandemic people had more money in the bank more wealth in the bank than they had at the beginning of the pandemic while many of them were not working we also suspended mortgages we suspended rents we did all of these things we blew out the spending in extraordinary extraordinary ways we did all of this while producing no product so we just it was helicopter money we just dropped money on millions and hundreds of millions of people while simultaneously putting small businesses out of business by telling people they couldn't go to a restaurant they couldn't go to a small mom-and-pop store you could go to a big chain store because after all you had to shop but you couldn't go to like a small mom and pop store so all those places went out of business but here's a check to compensate you for your trouble so what are you doing that's much more money chasing much less product what does that do that creates inflation so that's factor number two which is how much money the government spent this also means that if bruce is looking at future inflation and bruce is also looking for maybe just a little bit of that hard asset that has never been worth zero gold from our good friends over at birch one way that people have historically protected against the predations of the market and inflation has been precious metals 40 years ago ronald reagan saw massive inflation unlike anything the country had seen before that's super high inflation we're talking like 10 15 20 inflation and um and now uh oh in reagan's own words inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber as deadly as a hitman right now your retirement accounts are under attack thanks to the inflationary policies of this administration so if you haven't yet called birch gold i'm asking you why not those are the people i trust to help you diversify your 401k and ira into gold birch gold

these big boys come in and they decide you know what we need to not only temporarily backstop the economy we need to just superheat superheat the economy so you understand at the very beginning that the federal reserve which had not experienced as we say serious inflation in the united states for 40 years for 40 years the idea of inflation had become sort of a thing of the past so much so that there were people on the left who were suggesting that there was something called modern monetary theory you could literally spend as much money as you could possibly want and it would do no damage you would not get major inflation you would never have to pay it off it would be totally fine right this was an actual viable theory like two years ago elizabeth warren was promoting it and now it becomes clear that we've got this over here okay so what did jerome powell do he made a mistake he thought that if there was inflation it would be temporary because after all the demand that he had artificially created would eventually be met by the supply and now that relied on a couple of things one it relied on actual solving of the supply chain problem which we've discussed before but also it relied on the idea that things weren't being overvalued simply by the fact that there was so much money swimming around in the economy okay so the basic idea here is that the lending rate to the banks was was zero right it was free it was free for the federal for the banks to lend each other money and for the banks to to borrow money from the federal all that was zero okay so what that did is it led to an enormous amount of the bank taking out money and then investing in products that they wouldn't normally invest in so for example carnival cruises goes down right six billion dollars or six billion dollars on a stock price because the cruises are going to be shut down for a couple of years instead of carnival going bankrupt basically the federal reserve tells the banks we will back your play so the federal reserve starts buying up assets like never before in human history the federal reserve is currently holding nine trillion dollars in assets nine trillion dollars in assets okay they do this by buying up all sorts of product from the bank and then injecting a bunch of money to the banks which the banks then lend out at very low rates of interest this spurs demand it's first investment it means that you're going to get an inflated stock market bubble you get an inflated real estate bubble but jerome powell kept saying that the inflation was temporary the supply chains would clear up the overspending would would eventually kind of work its way out and the market is sort of like a bump in a snake moving back toward the rear of the snake and eventually everything would clear out well the problem is that the combination of all of these factors buying up nine trillion dollars in assets and sending all this cash into the system which is then being distributed out to a business and being distributed out to a mortgage and being distributed out to an individual right all that money that's out there is then inflating all the pricing so bottom line is what you end up with is is a three-factor disaster area that leads to long-lasting inflation factor number one supply chain factor number two overspending factor number three the fed okay that combo is going to create superheated inflation which is why you see it in the us but you don't really see it as much over in europe so when joe biden says it's just the supply chain that's not correct it's overspending it's the fed it's not just me saying this it's former obama administration under secretary of the treasury stephen ratner okay there are a lot it's larry summers this is not merely a supply chain phenomenon it is also overspending it's also the fed which is why when joe biden says what we really really need to do is spend more money all he's doing is making this worse when he says what if we had the fed continue to set the rates really really low all that is doing is making this worse now to jerome powell's credit and to the credit of the federal reserve they're now trying to bring this down right they're trying to get they're going to try to divest themselves with those nine trillion dollars in assets they're going to raise the overnight interest rates in order to ensure that less money goes into the system they're going to try and suck money out of the system and put those assets back into the system okay all of that is going to lower the phenomenon of monetary inflation there's only one really big problem in the long run supply chains will iron themselves out they will there's one really big problem and that one's this one and the fact is that one ain't going away that's not going away as we suggested when you have 30 trillion dollars in national debt that means the interest payments on the debt are going to comprise an enormous chunk of your budget in future years it means you're gonna have to raise taxes it means you're gonna have to pay people back somehow okay how are you gonna do that the answer is probably economic stagnation that's what i am afraid of i'm not as concerned about inflation being a long lasting phenomenon it'll get cleared up may take a year might take two years but in the end what we did here is we completely reshaped the nature of the economy in the united states we made ourselves way more dependent on the government not only did we make ourselves way more dependent on the government we spent more money has ever been spent in human history we've set a new baseline on what kind of things we will spend money on if that continues you're going to see low growth from here out into the future that's the real danger so as inflation clears up watch for stagnation to set in,0.064,0.835,0.1,0.9983,0.11491442542787286,0.1491442542787286,0.044009779951100246,0.17114914425427874,0.1198044009779951,0.09046454767726161,0.09046454767726161,0.2200488997555012,0.958948819521616,0.8541794943837017
q5dy-NtVeF0,1.0,0,this video is sponsored by one dream stay tuned for a special offer for arvanash viewers you probably know this familiar story in the beginning the universe was packed tightly together into a point of infinite density it then exploded into the universe we see today this is commonly thought of as the big bang astrophysicists will tell you that this image we have of the big bang is incorrect first there was no explosion like a grenade where all kinds of shrapnel goes flying away there was no substance like stars or galaxies or even atoms that went flying the entire universe itself expanded and became bigger atoms only coalesced a few hundred thousand years later as temperatures cooled and larger structures took much longer to form the big bang was not when the universe had zero size or infinite density it is just a moment in time when the universe was very hot and very dense and the big bang did not happen at some special point in space but everywhere in the known universe at the same time and contrary to popular belief the big bang model is not a theory of how the universe began science doesn't currently tell us how or why the universe came to exist or what caused it to start expanding the big bang model is about events that happened in the early universe which led to the universe we observed today that history is well understood and has been verified by evidence that we can observe even today 13.8 billion years later but up until the 1980s this model failed to explain some other observed properties of the universe which remained puzzles like why is it so homogeneous why its geometry appears flat and why there are no magnetic monopoles along came the theory of cosmic inflation proposed by alan guth and others which solved many of these puzzles and is today considered by most physicists to be a standard part of early big bang cosmology what is this theory of inflation how does it solve some of the most nagging cosmological puzzles and what caused it to happen that's coming up right now today the evidence for the big bang model is so strong that virtually no scientists seriously disputes that it's an accurate description of the history of our observable universe but some observations leading up to the 1970s had found some mysteries that the model in its original form could not account for in order to develop into the universe that we see today the early universe had to have some very specific properties some of which seemed implausible with the early big bang model specifically the questions left unanswered in the model were why was the early universe so uniform why is the universe so close to being geometrically flat and why do we not see any magnetic monopoles which could theoretically exist in 1981 american physicist alan guth wrote a paper in which he proposed the idea of cosmic inflation which could solve these apparent mysteries this is not the kind of inflation that makes your money worth less it means a sudden expansion the simplest version of the theory of inflation says that the universe expanded exponentially fast faster than the speed of light near its earliest history from what is believed to be the beginning of the universe from about 10 to the negative 36 seconds after the big bang to 10 to the negative 32 seconds during this time it expanded a factor of at least 10 to the 78 going from being very small to being exponentially large in comparison you might be thinking i thought things couldn't move faster than the speed of light einstein's theory of special relativity shows that this speed limit applies to things moving within space but not the expansion of space itself so this is permissible note that not all physicists agree that the beginning that is the point when time first started t equals zero is the same as the beginning of the big bang some physicists believe that the big bang happened after inflation around 10 to the negative 12 seconds also note that some descriptions of inflation say something like the universe started out smaller than an atom and then expanded to the size of a grapefruit you should keep in mind that these analogies can be misleading because they imply that the universe has an edge it doesn't there's only the universe and nothing else there is no outside and while we're at it let's dispel some other common misunderstandings about the beginning of the universe the idea that the universe started from a singularity that is a point of infinite density and heat is not correct it's purely due to mathematical extrapolation it's like getting a zero in the denominator of a mathematical equation it is undefined and represents the limit of our knowledge a singularity is probably not a physical thing and is really not what the big bang theory says it is part of the standard model of cosmology basically what the theory says is that the universe today is bigger than it was yesterday and is much bigger than it was a billion years ago so as you extrapolate back the universe gets smaller and smaller denser and denser and hotter and hotter so as you keep going you get to a very small volume of space which is very dense and very hot at some point in this extrapolation our equations stop working because the volume becomes zero but there were probably some other laws of physics that applied at this stage perhaps some kind of quantum gravity that is gravity at infinitesimally small scales we don't have such a theory yet this is something that physicists are feverishly working on along the same lines the universe today is expanding but galaxies aren't actually moving at that expansion rate only the space between galaxies is becoming larger and only on very large scales gravity also plays a role so that on smaller scales gravity still holds stars together within a galaxy and certain nearby galaxies are still attracted to each other like the andromeda galaxy is to our milky way galaxy while the whole universe may come from a tiny volume of space cosmic inflation would have caused all points within that space to expand and this expansion or inflation happened everywhere in space there is no center of the universe or location every point moved away from every other point expansion faster than the speed of light during inflation also means that these points while they may have been causally connected initially would have moved apart after inflation such that they became causally disconnected this is because causality is limited to the speed of light no information can travel faster than the speed as a consequence of this there are certain parts of the universe that we will never be able to see or detect in any way because any light or gravity coming from it will never reach us now let's see how inflation could explain the three problems of the big bang model the observed homogeneity the flatness issue and no observed magnetic monopoles issue when we look out into space we see that the universe on large scales is pretty much uniform the universe is extremely homogeneous and isotropic which is just a physics jargon for saying it appears roughly the same everywhere you look this can also be seen in the cosmic microwave background or cmb where the tiny differences you see on this image represent temperature fluctuations of at most only 0.0001 kelvin or less than one ten thousandth of one degree to see how inflation explains why the early universe was so uniform let's imagine that before inflation the universe was completely random maybe in one place the density was very high and a fraction of a millimeter off to the side the density was very low you can imagine it like the surface of a deflated balloon there may be tiny imperfections like different thicknesses and wrinkles randomly distributed on it now imagine that this balloon is suddenly inflated to a very large size a tiny fraction of a second later the wrinkle in the balloon surface gets smoothed out any density differences of the balloon's skin become diluted this is analogous to what happened during inflation as a tiny volume increased by at least 10 to the 78x now let's look at the flatness problem imagine living like an ant on the surface of a very small balloon it would be a two dimensional world but if the balloon was tiny enough it might be obvious to you that this surface was curved and that you were living in a closed or curved universe however if that ball was expanded to the sides of the earth it would appear flat to you even though it is still a sphere on much larger scales now scale that up to human size and the ball being much larger than even the observable universe to you it would appear to be flat as far as you could see even though it might have been obviously curved to start with inflation stretches any initial curvature of the three-dimensional universe to near flatness we don't know if the universe is 100 flat but if there is curvature it is so small that we can't measure it with our current technology note that when i say curvature it would be an overall curvature of the universe in four dimensions this is not easy to visualize so we have to visualize it as a 3d curvature of a 2d balloons surface a closed curvature for the universe would mean that two parallel lines would eventually converge in our 3d universe just like two parallel lines on the 2d surface of a balloon converge how does inflation solve the monopole problem the fact that we can observe no magnetic monopoles in the universe well monopoles can only theoretically form at very high temperatures the kinds of temperatures that were only present during the big bang but once they formed they should be stable enough to survive the idea is that inflation would have quickly cooled down the universe because of rapid expansion and only monopoles created prior to inflation would then continue to exist in the universe but during inflation the density of monopoles would drop exponentially so their abundance would drop to undetectable levels because they would exist in such low densities imagine that just before inflation there were a thousand monopoles and they were all packed into a cubic meter of space a fraction of a second later those monopoles were spread out in a region 10 to the 78 cubic meters across this would make them so rare that we may never detect them now as the cmb attests the universe is not completely smooth we can see that there are small imperfections small temperature differences this is called the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background you might say well doesn't this ruin the idea of inflation if the universe isn't completely uniform no these small anisotropies are exactly what we would expect inflation only makes the large scales like the cmb look uniform but the small anisotropics can actually explain the origin of the observed structure in the universe prior to inflation the universe we see today was microscopic the quantum fluctuations within the density of matter could have expanded to astronomical scales during inflation and this is what we see across the universe as the higher density regions condensed into stars galaxies and galaxy clusters now the big question you may be asking is how did the universe start what was responsible for inflation this is not well understood it is thought that there may have been a scalar inflation field during the time of the big bang now what is a scalar field as an analogy imagine a room with a fireplace in it every point in that room will have a temperature associated with it so if you were to measure the temperature anywhere in that room it will have some kind of distribution we would be measuring just a magnitude of the temperature this is akin to a scalar field it has only a magnitude now imagine that same room with a giant magnet in the middle of it every point in that room will have a magnetic field which will not only have a magnitude but also a direction in other words if you had a charged particle or small magnet somewhere in that room that object would experience a force that has not only a magnitude but also a different direction depending on its location in the room this is like a vector field it has a magnitude and a direction magnetic fields and gravitational fields are vector fields like this the higgs field and the inflation field are scalar fields analogous to the temperature in the room from a theoretical point of view assuming that an inflation field existed we can show this field with the following diagram in the very early very hot universe the inflation field would have had some value at a point a this would have been the lowest energy density that the field could be in at that high temperature and energies of the universe at that time the theoretical inflatance or particles of the inflation field would have remained at this point however point a would not have been the true vacuum but a false vacuum because as temperatures cooled the field formed a lower energy potential at point c since a was not the lowest point in terms of energy density it is called a false vacuum the natural place for the field to be as the universe cooled and got to lower temperatures and energies was actually c the lowest energy density of the field all natural systems tend towards their lowest energy state so when the inflation field is stuck at a it will tend towards c but before it can get there it has to overcome a small barrier b this can be accomplished with the help of quantum tunneling this can allow the field to overcome the barrier at b and drop down to its lowest energy state at c when the energy difference between point a and point c becomes very large larger than any other energy in the universe inflation starts and when the field reaches the lowest minimum energy density in the potential at point c inflation comes to a stop this is a very short process because as i said earlier inflation lasts only from about 10 to the negative 36 seconds to about 10 to the negative 32 seconds after the beginning so the scalar field causes the almost instantaneous exponential expansion that we call cosmic inflation as this field reaches its lowest potential inflation ends and it decays into other fields and particles after this event the universe continues to expand but in the slower way that the original big bang model described so inflation theory solved several problems in one fell swoop in my next video i'll cover an even more fascinating aspect of inflation and that is the theory of eternal inflation this theory if correct would mean that our universe is but one of a near endless myriad of universes most of which are unimaginably bigger than ours this could also actually explain why our universe is like the way it is so stay tuned for that i'd like to give a big shout out to professor gary felder of smith college who inspired this video he has a wonderful course on one dream today's sponsor it's a detailed college-level 12-part course on the big bang theory including cosmic inflation and all its implications if my video has tickled some curious bones in your body and you want to learn much more about this subject and cosmology in general in my opinion you're not going to find any lecture series more comprehensive and easier to understand than this course on one dream this is why i've been a member of one dream for a long time i couldn't recommend them more you'll even see my testimonial at the bottom of one dream's homepage

wZDE-SWZAuE,1.0,0,prices went up infamously during the Carter presidency inflation was increasing and unemployment was increasing at the same time we are kind of with a problem of inflation inflation is our friend everybody feels very poor there's a lot of people that just aren't making it it's a tough problem the question is how long will this go on the vocal rule today I'm going to talk about the cause of the great inflation of the 1970s let's get started the great inflation was the defining macroeconomic event when the economy changed a lot it happened in the second half of the 20th century Here and Now declares unconditional war on poverty in America this period lasting from 1965 to 1982 caused economists to rethink the policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks over the almost two decades it lasted there were four economic recessions two severe energy shortages and the unprecedented peacetime use of wage and price controls after the global monetary system created during World War II was abandoned it was according to one prominent Economist the greatest failure of American macroeconomic policy in the post-war period that failure had a big impact on economic theory and the rules that control money policies at the Federal Reserve and other Global central banks if the great inflation was a result of bad American Economic Policy then fixing it should be counted as a success now let's go into the forensics of the great inflation in 1964 inflation was about one percent each year it had been in this range for the previous six years inflation began to escalate in the mid-1960s and reached more than 14 percent in 1980. it eventually fell to three and a half percent in the latter half of the 1980s while economists debate the relative importance of the factors that motivated and perpetuated inflation for more than a decade there is little debate about its source the great inflation was caused by too much money in the economy the Federal Reserve created this problem by promoting policies that encouraged too much growth in the money supply this episode of bad economic and monetary policy can be difficult to understand to make it easier to follow I will tell the story in three parts this is a forensic examination of the motive means and opportunity for the great inflation to occur the motive the Phillips curve and the pursuit of Full Employment first just what is the Phillips curve it's simply an economic concept stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship however the original concept has been disproven by what happened in the 1970s when there was high inflation and unemployment at the same time the unemployment rate soared to 8.2 percent Nationwide last month the first portion of the story The motive underlying the great inflation dates back to the immediate aftermath of the Great Depression when macroeconomic Theory and policy were similarly transformed after World War II ended Congress focused on creating policies that it hoped would promote economic stability the Employment Act of 1946 was one of the most important laws to come out of that time period among other things the ACT said that it is the responsibility of the federal government to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power and to make sure that there is better coordination between fiscal and monetary policies this act which is often regarded as the father of the federal reserve's modern dual mandate established the Federal reserve's current two-part mission to maintain long-term growth and monetary and credit Aggregates to promote effectively the goals of Maximum employment stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates after World War II many countries followed a policy called Keynesian stabilization this policy was motivated by the painful memory of high unemployment rates in the 1930s at the consumer level America may not look much like an economy in distress but in shops and supermarkets in the residential suburbs inflation is now beginning to bypass the goal of these regulations was to control how much people spend known as Demand by managing the government and Central bank's spending and Taxation policies as well as their monetary policies today the notion that monetary policy May and should be used to control aggregate spending and keep the economy on a stable track is still largely accepted but one critical and erroneous assumption to the implementation of the stabilization policy of the 1960s and 1970s was that there was a stable relationship between unemployment and inflation that could be exploited specifically it was generally believed that permanently lower rates of unemployment could be bought with modestly higher rates of inflation the idea that the Phillips curve represented a longer term trade-off between unemployment which was very harmful to economic well-being and inflation which was sometimes perceived as an inconvenience appealed to policymakers who wanted to implement the Employment Act strictly however the stability of the Philips curve was a dangerous assumption one that economists Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman warned about said Phelps if the statical optimum is chosen it is reasonable to suppose that the participants in product and labor markets will learn to expect inflation and that as a consequence of their rational anticipatory Behavior the Phillips curve will gradually shift upward to summarize If the Fed wanted to pursue a policy of lower unemployment and more inflation while maintaining price stability it would be making a false bargain in which inflation must rise ever faster in order to keep up now for the means the collapse of Bretton Woods chasing the Phillips curve in pursuit of lower unemployment could not have occurred if the policies of the Federal Reserve were well anchored and in the 1960s the US dollar was anchored albeit very tenuously to Gold through the Bretton Woods agreement so the story of the great inflation is in part also about the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the separation of the U.S dollar from its last link to gold during World War II the world's industrial Nations agreed to a global monetary system that they hope would bring greater economic stability and peace this system would promote global trade that system which was created by 44 nations in Bretton Woods New Hampshire in July 1944 provided for a fixed rate of exchange between the currencies of the world and the US dollar and the US dollar was linked to gold however the Bretton Woods system had a number of flaws in its implementation one of the biggest problems was that it tried to keep fixed parity between Global currencies which was incompatible with the domestic economic goals of different countries as a consequence many nations were pursuing monetary policies that would move the Phillips curve up and to the right in order to create a more favorable unemployment inflation link the United States status as the world's main currency has presented additional issues as global trade increased demand for U.S dollar reserves increased as well for a Time the demand for dollars was met by an expanding balance of payments deficit and foreign central banks amass more and more dollar Reserves eventually the number of dollar reserves held abroad exceeded the U.S stock of gold indicating that the United States could not maintain full convertibility at current gold prices a fact that would not go unnoticed by Foreign governments and currency speculators as inflation increased during the latter part of the 1960s people started to trade more US dollars for gold in the summer of 1971 President Nixon stopped this exchange so that the U.S dollar would not lose its value I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other Reserve assets for the first time in history the dollar was just a piece of paper backed only by faith in the Federal Reserve and its policies your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today promise was only as good as the FED actions behind it but bowing to pressure from Nixon and clinging to flawed economic theories the FED refused to raise rates [Music] over the next decade the cost of living more than doubled the dollar lost more than half its value during the next two years there was an effort to salvage the global monetary system through the brief Libs Smithsonian agreement but the new Arrangement fared no better than Bretton Woods and soon collapsed the post-war Global monetary system was finished the final link to Gold cut most of the world's currencies were suddenly and completely unanchored this was the first time in history that most of the money in the world was on a paper money standard that could not be redeemed for anything valuable now for the opportunity fiscal imbalances energy shortages and bad data the late 1960s and early 1970s were difficult times for the U.S economy inflation's built severe distortions into the economy on the industrial front it's the car manufacturers who've been hardest hit President Johnson's Great Society legislation brought about major spending programs across a broad array of social initiatives at a time when the U.S fiscal situation was already being strained by the Vietnam War these growing fiscal imbalances make it more difficult to make monetary policy in order to avoid interfering the treasury's funding plans the Federal Reserve followed a policy of conducting even Keel policies this meant the central bank would not alter its policy and would not adjust interest rates in the period between the announcement of a treasury issue and its sale to the market under normal circumstances treasury issues were rare and the fed's even Keel policies had little influence on the implementation of monetary policy however as debt problems became more prevalent the fed's adherence to the Ian Keel principle began restricting monetary policy a more disruptive force was the repeated energy crises that increased oil costs and sapped U.S growth the first crisis was an Arab Oil Embargo that began in October 1973 and went on for about five months during this period crude oil prices quadrupled I've been in two gas lines already this morning this morning why doesn't anybody contact the president why is he letting this happen to us they reached a plateau that held until the Iranian Revolution brought a second energy crisis in 1979. the second crisis tripled the cost of oil in the 1970s economists and policy makers began to understand that there were different types of inflation this was when they saw the increase in prices across all sectors demand and pole inflation was caused by government policies and specifically monetary policy it resulted from policies that produced a level of spending in excess of what the economy could produce without pushing the economy Beyond its ordinary productive capacity and pulling more expensive resources into play but inflation could also be pushed Higher by disruptions in the supply of food and energy this cost push inflation also got passed through the chain of production into higher retail prices from the Viewpoint of the Central Bank the increasing cost of oil was largely out of its hands but the increase in unemployment that was occurring in response to the jump in oil prices was not the Federal Reserve responded to a mandate to establish full employment with little or no Reserve management anchor by allowing huge and growing fiscal imbalances and fighting against the energy related headwinds these policies accelerated the amount of money in the economy and raised prices without reducing unemployment and Arthur Burns chairman of the fit he did not do what a good Central Banker should do and raise rates to break the inflation and by the time the 70s ended it was a total mess bad data or at least a bad understanding of the data also handicapped policymakers they've made decisions based on inaccurate information which resulted in them making poor choices looking back at the information policymakers had in hand During the period leading up to and during the great inflation Economist athanasio's orphanites has shown that the real-time estimate of potential output was significantly overstated and the estimate of the rate of unemployment consistent with full employment was significantly understated in other words policymakers were likely underestimating the inflationary effects of their policies in fact without increasing inflation the policy path there were almost simply untenable but wait there's more the Phillips curve which was a crucial reference for Federal Reserve policy decisions began a shift and finally from high inflation to inflation targeting the conquest of U.S inflation the stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment turned out to be unstable as Phelps and Friedman correctly predicted the ability of policy makers to control any real variable was not permanent this truth included the rate of unemployment which oscillated around its natural rate the policy makers hoped to find a trade-off but it did not exist as businesses and households came to appreciate indeed anticipate Rising prices any trade-off between inflation and unemployment became a less favorable exchange until in time unemployment became unacceptably high this became the era of stagflation in 1964 when this story began the inflation rate was one percent and the unemployment rate was five percent Ten Years Later inflation would be more than 12 percent and unemployment would be more than seven percent by the summer of 1980 inflation was approaching 14 and a half percent and unemployment was over seven and a half percent Federal Reserve officials were not blind to the inflation that was occurring and were well aware of their two goals to achieve full employment and price stability the Employment Act of 1946 was recodified in 1978 by the Full Employment and balance growth act commonly known as the Humphrey Hawkins act after the Bill's sponsors Humphrey Hawkins charges the Federal Reserve to pursue Full Employment and price stability the Central Bank must also set targets for different monetary Aggregates and provide a semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress despite this the employment half of the Mandate appeared to be more important when there was a conflict between Full Employment and inflation as fed chairman Arthur Burns would later claim full employment was the primary objective in the Publix and government's eyes if not also in those of the Federal Reserve however it was also clear that trying to solve the inflation problem would have been too costly for the economy and jobs there have been a few previous attempts to reduce inflation without the additional burden of higher unemployment the Nixon Administration put in place wage and price controls in three different phases between 1971 and 1974. the controls only temporarily slowed the rise in prices however I hope that independently he will conclude that My Views are the ones that should be followed this made the shortages worse especially for food and energy the Ford administration had no better luck when they tried to control inflation after declaring inflation Enemy Number One the tyranny of double-digit inflation is our common enemy in 1974. the president in 1974 introduced the whip inflation now program this voluntary program had measures to encourage people to save more money but it failed by the late 1970s the general public had come to expect an inflationary bias in monetary policy and they were increasingly unhappy with inflation many surveys showed that the public lost confidence in the economy and government policy during the second half of the 1970s and often inflation was identified as a special evil interest rates appear to be on a secular rise since 1965 and spiked sharply higher still as the 1970s came to a close during this time business Investments slowed down in productivity weakened the nation's trade balance with other countries worsened and inflation was seen as a major cause of the economic problems or the main reason for them but once policymakers found themselves in a position with high inflation and high unemployment they faced an unhappy dilemma is very difficult to fight high unemployment and inflation at the same time if you try to fight High inflation it could cause the unemployment rate to go up in 1979 Paul volcker who had previously served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was named chairman of the Federal Reserve board when he took office in August the inflation rate year over year was more than 11 percent and the unemployment rate was close to 6 percent by this time it was generally accepted that reducing inflation requires controlling the growth rate of reserves and money in general the Federal Open Market Committee had already started to set goals for how much money should be in the economy this is required by a law called the Humphrey Hawkins Act however it was clear that sentiment was changing with the new chairman and that stronger measures to control the growth of the money supply were required in October 1979 the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it would Target Reserve growth instead of the Fed fund's rate as its policy instrument even if it had the effect of temporarily disrupting economic activity and for a Time increasing joblessness inflation was now seen as essential to both aims of the Dual mandate in early 1980 Volker said my basic philosophy is over time we have no choice but to deal with the inflationary situation because over time inflation and the unemployment rate go together volcker had tried to get the FED Governors to nudge interest rates upward without success so he tried a different attack persuading them to focus on controlling the money supply it was a sleight of hand because the two are essentially the same but it was a politically palatable tactic and it worked and when he slowed the money growth rate predictably the interest rate went way up over time the desired slowing of inflation was achieved by having greater control over reserve and money growth although this was not perfect it worked well enough this tighter Reserve management was made stricter with the introduction of credit controls in early 1980 and with a monetary Control Act interest rates changed a lot in 1980. they went out then down for a bit and then would back up again lending activity fell unemployment Rose and the economy went into a brief recession between January and July inflation fell but was still high even as the economy recovered in the second half of 1980. however the volcker FED continued to fight High inflation with a combination of higher interest rates and slower Reserve growth in July 1981 the economy fell into a recession again which proved to be more severe and drawn out than the previous one unemployment peaked at nearly 11 percent but inflation continued to move lower and by the recession's end year-over-year inflation was back under 5 percent in time the fed's commitment to low inflation gained credibility and unemployment drop as a result of strong economic growth the great inflation was over yeah I think it's fair to say that was a difficult time by this time a macroeconomic theory had changed dramatically as a result of the economic lessons of the era in macroeconomic models the essential function that public expectations play in the link between economic policy and economic performance has become standard practice making time consistent policy choices choices that don't sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term gains and having policy credibility are important for good macroeconomic results today central banks understand that a commitment to price stability is essential for good monetary policy most central banks including the Federal Reserve have adopted specific numerical objectives for inflation these numerical inflation targets have helped to control inflation by providing an anchor for monetary policy and in so doing they have also increased transparency and reduced uncertainty now recognized to be critical prerequisites for long-term development and maximum employment so what can we learn from the great inflation of the 1970s for one it's a reminder that economic policies have real world consequences it also underscores the importance of keeping an eye on inflation and all other economic indicators to avoid nasty surprises down the road finally it serves as a cautionary tale about giving Central Bankers too much power something we should bear in mind as we watch current events unfold here at

Khou5Qz4A4E,2.0,0,inflation is the textbook term for prices rising over time and purchasing power falling think of a trip to the grocery store it sets you back 100 a year from now you buy all the same items but they now cost a hundred and three dollars that's inflation three percent to be exact so what causes inflation a rise in production costs is one scenario for example booming energy prices can drive up the cost of transportation or manufacturing rising wages can also contribute to inflation if business owners have to pay workers more they might also raise prices to cover those higher labor costs inflation can also happen when the demand for goods exceeds supply then businesses selling those items can increase prices prices going up slowly is generally considered a good thing especially if wages rise too it helps keep the economy dynamic and growing the u.s central bank has even a target inflation rate 2 percent but inflation can quickly get out of control when governments print too much money to pay for spending when not enough real value underlies that paper prices surge that's called hyperinflation it happened in germany in zimbabwe in the 2000s and most recently in venezuela and it's the fed's job to make sure the united states keeps the inflation rate on track,0.038,0.856,0.106,0.9592,0.041666666666666664,0.25,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.1875,0.020833333333333332,0.125,0.20833333333333334,0.8458352018040295,0.8133680555555556

the highest inflation in more than 10 years chicken eggs meat a pound of steak is up by two bucks pound of bacon cost over $7 $7 bacon $7 bacon so what happened the official inflation story in the media goes like this workers are demanding too much money cost of raw materials and transportation are going up and the bided Administration has pumped too much money into the economy but that's not the full picture there's something that Corporate America doesn't want you to know we search through SEC filings monitored corporate earnings calls and looked through corporate Financial reports and we found some startling evidence of what's really behind inflation this is the classroom for more perfect union here's a clip from one of the people who has control over prices John katum matiis president of graes and dagostino supermarkets he's also a real estate and oil CEO you know how CEOs are on Wall Street uh they go they live quarter by quarter uh if they're off by a penny in earnings Wall Street is not forgiven so what are the CEOs doing they're raising prices I see food pric is going up promotions are down to zero why give away something when you don't have to give it away and you make more margin that's a confession why give away something when you don't have to give it away and you make more margin Business Leaders are admitting that corporations are using The Narrative of hyperinflation as an excuse to raise prices on you and increase profits for themselves let's look at some corporate earnings calls that's where companies tell investors how much money the company is making and their plans to make more a study by Bank of America found that the these reports mentioned inflation 1,00% more in the second quarter of 2021 than in the previous year but while they blame inflation for Rising prices the largest corporations in America have never made more money The Wall Street Journal reported that two out of three of the biggest US publicly traded companies had larger profit margins this year than they did prior to the pandemic in 2019 nearly 100 of these massive corporations reported profits in 2021 that are 50% above profit margins in 2019 this is a clip from the 2021 third quarter earnings of Tyson the meat processor whose chicken you might have in your freezer we have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation pricings improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year some quick business talk translation when he says pricing improved he means Tyson was happy to raise prices and that was good news news for Tyson shareholders Tyson wants people like you and me to believe that they were forced to raise prices as a result of inflation but the company is making almost double what it made the year before inflation gave them the excuse they needed to raise prices and reap record profits here's legendary investor Warren Buffett explaining that businesses are finding they can simply raise prices without it hurting their sales it's very interesting I mean it we're raising prices people are raising prices to us uh and it's being accepted here's Kellogg CEO Steve kahain who made $1.6 Million last year if you look backwards and you see what we've done you know we've been successful at driving pricing the good news is elasticities have performed uh very well so they've been lower than historically elasticity that's how much a company can change a price and get away with it people will still buy it in the same call Kellogg's and announced our gross profit dollars are up through the first 9 months of this year Kelloggs isn't alone mandes the giant multinational Food corporation that makes everything from Oreos double stuff and not to Halls cough drops the Philadelphia Cream Cheese plans to raise prices by 7% in 2022 despite a record $1.08 billion in profits in the second quarter of 20121 that's double the profits of the year before corporations are seizing the opportunity to engage in massive profiteering because they can they want to report higher profits to their investors so their stock prices go higher they don't care you have to pay more for your groceries so as big companies raise prices what are our politicians corporate media and CEOs blame me it on Common Sense social spending programs and labor rights or anything that could strengthen our nation's working class you pay people to stay home you inflect more money into the economy from government which only drives up inflation yeah that's the most powerful Republican in the house saying the reason we can't give people unemployment is because they'll put that money back into the economy some other conservatives were super close to getting it every month since Joe Biden took the oath of office prices have risen faster than wages the question is are your wages Rising as fast as your costs probably not but Carlson and baraso don't call for higher wages they immediately pivot to ripping on social spending programs like McCarthy people are feeling the pain and the bite taken out of their wallet even without the specific yet raised taxes that the Democrats are proposing the American people have already taken a pay cut no government in the history of the world has ever spent more money than Joe Biden is spending right now you know that people say we're going to raise the taxes only on corporations I mean that is dumber than uh dog dooo I mean the corporations are just going to pass it on to the consumer corporations are just going to pass it on to the consumer this strategy hiding price increases and massive margins behind an economic term isn't new politicians corporate media and ultrarich CEOs used to use the deficit as a scare tactic to prevent government spending but now it's big bad inflation they're hyping to convince people we can't afford programs most Americans want like Universal prek infrastructure Investments guaranteed paay time off food assistance and Paid Family Leave inflation is real but it's important to know who to blame it's not social spending programs or workers demanding higher wages it's large corporations through

GcaiTZKlCj4,1.0,1,"all right so today we're going to do a nice educational one uh topical about the main issues which people are worried about today that we get asked about a lot which are inflation, interest rates and house prices often viewed I think as 3 separate concerns but they're very very linked they're very related so I think if we cover all 3 of these and the way they're related it can really help people to understand how the economy works and what's happening now right so we're going to start with inflation so the first thing is we've covered this before but I'll go over it quickly I believe and I've said this many times on the channel, that the inflation was largely caused by the enormous amount of money given out by this government and governments all over the world during Covid uh the amounts are truly enormous £700billion in this country (UK) which is 14,000 pounds per adult, eight trillion dollars in the US which is about 30,000 dollars per adult huge amounts of money given out that amount of money has to end up somewhere ends up in the bank accounts of private individuals largely wealthier private individuals which means huge huge, nobody is denying this by the way this is generally accepted, enormous accumulation of cash by richer individuals in the last three years during Covid which is the reason why I said in the first video on this channel that when we come out of Covid we will probably see a big jump in inflation because there would have been this massive cash accumulation with rich individuals okay um that has not generally been the mainstream media explanation of inflation and they've been generally saying it's because of sort of an anonymous after effects of covid which never really explained in much detail and of course the Ukraine war I'm not denying that the war in Ukraine has caused inflation especially with specifically with energy that is a part of it as well but I think a big part of it is this massive cash accumulation during Covid if you give a huge amount of cash out what you essentially do is you devalue the currency because most people especially the rich have huge amount more money, more money going around, they can buy more things, they can push prices up, prices go up and you know we predicted it in advance and it happened!",0.041,0.835,0.124,0.9885,0.12857142857142856,0.18571428571428572,0.0,0.2,0.15714285714285714,0.014285714285714285,0.08571428571428572,0.22857142857142856,0.8645156100913761,0.8244897959183674
GcaiTZKlCj4,1.0,2,"what does that mean going forward okay so if I'm right and it was largely caused by this huge amount of money given out by the government you would expect a kind of relatively sharp jump in prices and then for prices to start going up much more slowly because the government gave a huge amount of money out in a short period of time and now they are still running a deficit higher than pre-covid and that is because basically there's been a massive increase in poverty since covid because of the inflation which means the government is now forced to for example subsidise people's energy which has cost the government, they're forced to provide more poverty benefits because people are struggling so the government gave a huge amount of money out and now they have to keep giving money up at a much slower rate so what I would expect to happen is a big increase in prices and then for prices to keep going up but not at this rapid rate so we've seen the big increase and what I expect happen now is that prices will will slow down they will keep going up because the government is still giving money out but they will not keep going up at the rapid rate so we will see a big fall in inflation um almost certainly it's important that people understand that a fall in inflation does not mean a fall in prices right, inflation is the rate of increase in prices so prices jumped a lot they will keep going up but that will slow down massively um inflation will probably fall to something like six seven percent maybe even lower this year that is just simply because the government is not giving so much money out the government will try and take credit for that but it's important to remember that if prices are still going up six seven percent a year then you know life is still getting harder life is still getting worse for you and the fall in inflation is really a fall in the rate of decrease of your living standards it's not really something for the government to be proud of okay so that's inflation covered for now inflation will probably normalise right I think it's because of the huge amount of money given out that that rich people still have, um other people think it's because of other things um let's move on to interest rates so interest rates have risen significantly here in the UK they're up to four and a quarter now (4.25%) financial markets... first thing to say is financial markets think that we are nearing the top now they think that interest rates will probably peak at something like four and a half maybe four and three quarters (4.5-4.75%) which means another just 1 or 2 increases in interest rates this year um I suspect that'll probably be right in the short term & then interest rates will start to slowly come down now there's been a lot of discussion about interest rates and I want to talk about this one because I think I think the situation is quite interesting right there's been a lot of criticism especially from the left, people saying what the hell is the Bank of England doing raising interest rates um and that's understandable because when the bank raises interest rates your mortgage rate goes up I think a lot of people are seeing massive increase in their mortgage rates it's causing a lot of problems um it increases the interest that the government has to pay on it's government debt government debt is massively increased in the last three years it's very large it's about 100% of GDP I think it's you know something like 30,000 pounds per person it's a lot um they have to pay a higher interest rate, if you have a mortgage you have to pay a higher interest rate um and people are understandably super stressed about that right and they're turning around to the Bank of England and they're saying 'well why are you doing this?",0.065,0.772,0.164,0.9973,0.0873015873015873,0.15873015873015872,0.023809523809523808,0.23809523809523808,0.10317460317460317,0.1111111111111111,0.09523809523809523,0.18253968253968253,0.93707194456404,0.8445452254976065
GcaiTZKlCj4,1.0,3,"because you're hurting us you're hurting us you're hurting the economy' and I think this provides opportunity for a really interesting discussion so the first thing to say is from my perspective the inflation has been caused by the government giving money out that has ended up with rich people and we discussed this exactly in the first video on the channel where we predicted the inflation right where we said if during covid the government is going to give 700 billion pounds to the rich the only way to avoid a crisis in inflation and inequality because that cash distribution increases both of those things, is to take money back from the rich through taxation policy you see that's symmetrical if I give you money then the way to reverse that and avoid the consequences of that are to then tax money from you okay but that's not what we're doing right what we're doing is the government has given money out which has ended up with the rich and then rather than taxing money back from the rich the Central Bank the Bank of England is increasing interest rates and this is because economists when they think of inflation they always think of interest rates this is what happens in economists minds if inflation is too high raise interest rates if inflation is too low lower interest rates these are like the articles of faith of being an economist they're really connected and they tend not to think in terms of fiscal policy so in economists minds they have these these ideas of two levers that rule the economy one is fiscal policy and that is government taxation and expenditure so during covid the government run a massive deficit that means they spent way more than they taxed, that is what they would call a fiscal stimulus, it's pouring money in in terms of government spending that's fiscal policy monetary policies is basically Central Bank interest rates it includes quantitative easing which we've covered before but I think to keep things simple let's just talk about interest rates and that is you lower the interest rate to speed the economy up, you raise the interest rate to speed the economy down it's important to recognise that these are two different things all right and both of them can affect inflation so if the government starts spending a ton of money and during Covid most of it's printed money that will push inflation up and if the Central Bank starts slashing interest rates that will also push inflation up but they're different things right and I think the most important thing to understand if you take anything away from this video is that we are clearly using the wrong policy to fix the inflation because if we cause the inflation by giving money to the rich then the way to fix it is to take money from the rich, if we try to fix it by raising interest rates what does that mean well interest rates are the money that is paid by borrowers in the economy to lenders in the economy and I remember we've covered this on the channel before that for every borrower there is a lender for every lender there is a borrower okay it's always perfectly matched you can't borrow money from nobody, you can't owe money to nobody okay so really when the Central Bank raises interest rates what they are doing is they are benefiting the lenders, so who are lenders?",0.044,0.785,0.17,0.9981,0.1386861313868613,0.13138686131386862,0.0,0.1897810218978102,0.11678832116788321,0.051094890510948905,0.10218978102189781,0.27007299270072993,0.8874585450633898,0.827854440833289
GcaiTZKlCj4,1.0,4,"lenders are people with large amounts of money who lend money out you know largely it's wealthy individuals you know sometimes it goes through your bank so if you have a huge amount of cash in the bank, your bank lends that money to government, your bank lends that money to mortgage borrowers, if you have a lot of money in your pension, your pension fund lends that money to the government, lends that money to mortgage borrowers right so people with large amounts of cash benefit when interest rates go up and the people who lose are people who have large amounts of borrowing which is the government first and foremost and people with mortgages people with large mortgages which is largely younger homeowners & also it doesn't include homeowners from rich families who don't have to use mortgages right so when you raise interest rates often you are benefiting rich people because they have a lot of cash and your disadvantaging the government and mortgagees; people who have mortgages, that is increasing inequality and it's not as simple as that right because there are some poorer people have all of their money in cash you may feel that they benefit there might be some rich people have a large amount of debt for example I have a large amount of debt as part of my sort of trading portfolio but in general when you raise interest rates you're moving money from borrowers which is mortgage holders and the government, to lenders which is rich individuals especially older rich individuals so when the government has given money out it's caused two things to happen 1. a massive increase in inequality & 2. a decrease in the value of the currency which we see as inflation if it wanted to perfectly offset that then it would tax the rich back but for some reason, which as you know i'm constantly maddened about, taxing the rich has never really been seriously in the discussion here even though we've seen a massive increase in the wealth of the rich, so instead we've gone for the default which is raising interest rates now raising interest rates does increase the value of the currency so the one half of it which is the devaluation of the currency you are fighting by raising interest rates but the other half which was an increase in inequality, raising interest rates makes that worse right because you're forcing borrowers who are often not wealthy families, if you're wealthy you wouldn't take a mortgage and the government which means the taxpayer which means ordinary working people because as we know the very wealthy don't pay high rates of tax the taxpayer and mortgage holders have to pay more money to the cash holders which are the people who've accumulated huge amounts of cash during Covid, which is the rich, so in trying to fix with monetary policy by the bank of England a problem which was caused the fiscal or taxation policy by the government you've ended up trying to fix a crisis of inequality by more inequality so that that means that the long run situation for the economy and for for inequality is extremely bad but it will succeed eventually in bringing inflation down and this I think is there'll be people who there will be some people who won't like me saying this it will be unpopular with some there's been a lot of criticism from the left of the central bank for their interest rate policy they're saying you know why are you raising interest rates it's hurting people if the bank of England kept interest rates at zero the pound would have collapsed in currency markets the pound would be worth half of what it is now we'd be seeing an inflation crisis and I mean it would be very similar to what happened after the trussonomics disaster in Autumn so I think people who are pointing at the Bank of England (BoE) and saying this is your fault listen I've got no love lost for the Bank of England or Andrew Bailey um I think that they have no choice but to do this, the problem is because the government and the broader economics discussion in the media have said nothing about taxing the rich which would be the correct way to fix it, the Central Bank has no option but to raise the interest rates you know if we I think an interesting thought experiment is to sit and think what if we reversed the cash distributions of the last three years what if we went to every single person in the top 10% of the country and said we want £140,000 tax that would be a reversal like that it seems crazy but that is what we have done in the last 3 years we've distributed £140,000 to the richest 5 million people in the country each person right so if we took that back you would see a collapse in inflation a massive collapses these people desperately tried to raise that cash right so the interest rates had to go up because we have refused to have the discussion about taxing the rich and if you give a ton of money to the rich inflation will increase if you refuse to take the money back the only option central banks have to try and keep inflation is to raise interest rates and it will happen but in terms of looking forward I believe that the inflation will come down when it safely quickly which means that the central banks including the Bank of England, the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) will stop raising rates relatively soon um I think that once that inflation slows down you will start to see how severe the economic weakness is underneath how big the increase in poverty is and you'll probably start seeing in my opinion interest rates start to fall relatively quickly but that that depends on whether there's a bit of a balance here right because because we've seen such a big increase in poverty it creates creates pressure on governments to do more deficit spending and pump more money in & if governments are forced to pump more money in that could keep inflation higher over the long term and I think what you're seeing here is kind of the death throws of an economy which has given up on tax taxing the rich so if you cannot tax the rich and the rich have all the assets then you end up in a situation where whenever there's a crisis the rich get a ton of money and you can't get it back so the only option you have is to raise interest rates and that causes more poverty which means you have to give more money to the rich it's a question basically you're trying to solve the question of how do you prevent poverty when you are giving all of the assets to a group of people that you can get nothing back from it's almost a question of imagine you gave your house and all of your assets everything you own to some rich guy and then you took a massive loan from him and you gave the money back to him so now you're in debt to him he owns everything how can you not be poor and the answer is you can't so if you keep trying to provide living standards without the ability to tax the people who increasingly own everything it's not possible so you will continue to see this Balancing Act between the government has to spend a deficit which keeps inflation High but I think what you will see in this country I think the conservative government has a big political problem with high interest rates and that takes us to our next point which is house prices so how do you buy a house in a world where you're poor and the rich have everything the answer is you borrow the money from the rich and that that's mortgages and mortgages have been the way that we have squared this circle for the last 20 years in this country which is the conservative government has quite a political need for people to own property because private renters and social renters almost never vote conservative um they need house prices to rise because that's the only reason that older people feel comfortable because the house prices are rising so they need to keep people owning property but inequality is rising and rising, the middle class are losing their assets so how do we keep ordinary people owning property when inequality is rising because rising inequality of wealth means you lose your assets but we need you to lose your assets but keep your house how is that possible the answer is increasing debt so you can keep your house and you can just get more and more and more and more in debt to the rich that way you stay a property owner so you keep voting conservative but you become poorer and poorer generation after generation so it's really mortgages and debt I like the magic solution that works for the government and that has been working for them for the last 15 years quite well politically because the rich get richer and richer because you owe them more and more and more money but you keep your house so everybody's winning the rich get richer you get poorer but you keep voting for them because you're a homeowner and what you want is for asset prices to go up it's really really good for the conservatives and it's really bad for people in general and this is why higher interest rates are a disaster for the conservatives because they need ordinary people to be taking huge amounts of debt and huge amounts of debt are not affordable for ordinary people at interest rates of six seven eight percent which is what a lot of mortgage rates have gone up to right so they need interest rates to come down they need interest rates to come down desperately so I think what they will do and what you're seeing them doing is they will try their best to run as much as possible an extreme austerity government in the next year and a half in a desperate attempt to bring inflation down quickly so that interest rates come down and as soon as interest rates come down you will start to see those house prices go up because of the thing we mentioned at the beginning of the video which is that 700 billion pounds which has been given out by the government the last three years is still sitting in the bank accounts of the rich and this is the big conflict we have right the rich have all that money and what would the rich people do with money they want to buy assets so house prices want to go up but rich people themselves don't want to go out and buy a ton of houses right because buying houses is a hassle you know you need to manage tenants, super rich people don't want to be having to fix poor people's boilers things like this they don't want to be involved in stuff like that so what they normally do is they lend the money out they lend the money out but suddenly poor people can't afford to borrow the money anymore so it's created this it's created this two forces in house prices which is on the one hand house prices should be going up because the rich have got a ton of money and it's important to be clear house prices have gone up by about 20% since the beginning of Covid, and now they've come down about 3-4% so that force of the rich having a ton of money push house prices up but now the mechanism by which rich people buy houses and I think this is an interesting thing to consider mortgages are in a very real way the way that rich people buy houses so I've got half a million pounds and you've got nothing and you want a house there's two ways I can give you housing I can buy the house myself and I can rent it to you or I can lend you the half a million pounds you can buy the house and instead of paying rent you pay me Interest financially it's very similar if you think about it in both cases I provide all of the money for the house to be bought and in one case you pay me rent and other case you pay me interest so really mortgages are the way that the rich buy houses for the poor but that channel has become blocked because the poor can no longer afford the interest um so I think there are two things that can possibly happen here and the way it will play out will depend on the country one is in this country I think the government will do everything they can to bring inflation down but that will come at the cost of really crushing the economy and crushing ordinary people um I think the way they'll hope to survive that is by making a bit of room to like throw a load of money immediately before the election they will try to bring the interest rates down and as soon as interest rates come down then you will see this flood of money that the rich have again they continue to push house prices up even though they've already gone up 20% I think they can go up a lot more if you look at after 2008 house prices basically doubled over the next 10-15 years and I think they can do that again so if the interest rates come down then this channel will open up again the interesting question is what if interest rates don't come down which is what could happen if governments are forced to keep running big deficits in that case you'll have the question of how do the rich people buy their houses when they can't lend the money out and I think what you will see if that happens is the rich will start buying the houses through corporations and you will start to see much more corporate landlording so I lived in Japan for a long time and I think increasingly in the US you're seeing rather than the rich lending the pool of money via mortgages the rich pull their money together into corporations so there's I think it's is it BlackRock or is it Blackstone in the U.S it's a massive company which owns a huge amount of housing, rich people pool their money together in corporations the corporations buy the houses and the corporations lend the money out because it's quite interesting at the moment you're seeing rents go through the roof at the same time as house prices go down and the rich are sitting on a huge pile of cash so it's a it's a massive investment opportunity for wealthy people with cash because rents are super high and they've got a ton of money and the prices are cheap so the rich should be buying these houses and bringing the rent in but the problem simply is rich people are you know too lazy to go and buy 10 houses right and it's becoming more it's it's cumbersome right rich people don't want to be becoming massive buy-to-let landlords right so but either way the money is there and that will force house prices up in the long term and I think what you're just seeing is the the mortgage channel get blocked in the meantime um but what you would inevitably see in any case is the massive gift of cash to the rich will manifest in increased inequality of real assets either through much higher mortgages which means a much higher amount of debt from ordinary families to the rich, we've already seen a much higher debt from the government to the rich and what you will see is increased direct holding of properties I think it's important to realise when that mortgage channel gets blocked it provides a massive opportunity for rich people who can just pay cash they don't need a mortgage they can just buy cash at the cheaper price get in that massive increase in rental income rents are going absolutely through the roof and they can profit from that so every single step of the way, Covid management meaning massive cash transfer from the government to the rich, higher interest rates meaning higher debt payments from mortgagees and the government to the rich and falling house prices at the same time as high mortgage rates means cheaper access to housing if you have the cash, which only rich people do, every single step of the way is benefiting the rich and hurting ordinary middle class families and there's nothing that will prevent this if we don't start discussing more seriously taxation of the rich so to make clear the predictions you know inflation will come down um it will still be positive for a while interest rates will stop going up and I think they'll probably start coming down it might take a year or two um house prices they're clearly falling at the moment even though they're still significantly higher than pre-covid I don't think that will last I think as soon as interest rates start falling they will start going up and even if they don't you'll just start seeing more more Corporate Land lording & I know these are pessimistic predictions uh we get a lot of people saying that these are pessimistic predictions but this is what happens if you don't text the rich and if you don't want bad outcomes you cannot allow inequality to get higher and higher so support the channel we're always pushing for higher taxation of the richest and that's you know that's the only way we're going to prevent these things I know that these are not good for ordinary families we can't fix it without without improving taxation policy so let's do that okay thats all",0.078,0.731,0.191,0.9999,0.1449044585987261,0.17038216560509553,0.03184713375796178,0.16878980891719744,0.11942675159235669,0.11464968152866242,0.08439490445859872,0.16560509554140126,0.9618131123938061,0.8585135299606474
Qx3YMdcLTZo,1.0,0,have you ever asked anyone to help you understand what inflation is chances are you would have heard an example something like this a cup of coffee cost rupees 25 three years ago and the same cup of coffee today cost 40 rupees over the last three years the purchasing power of money has diminished and this is generally attributed to a phenomena called inflation this definition of inflation is all right in a nutshell it helps you understand what inflation is but you as an active Market participant an active Trader and an investor should try and understand what inflation is and understand all the nuances around it so in this video let's try and understand what inflation is and ways in which the central bank and the government control inflation imagine there is a person who wants to buy a box of chocolate and there's another person willing to sell this box of chocolate now all else equal with no external forces acting on this transaction the demand matches the supply and therefore this transaction will go through here there is no incentive for the seller to increase the price of the box of chocolates now let's try and flip the situation instead of one buyer let's assume there are 10 buyers willing to buy the same box of chocolates and there is only one seller of this box of chocolate or maybe a very small group of sellers now what do you think is likely to happen of course there's an incentive for the sellers to increase the price of box of chocolate because they would want to maximize on the opportunity hence the price of the box of chocolate is likely to increase of course the Assumption here is that all 10 buyers have the actual money to buy the box of chocolate and it's not a fake expression of Interest so if you strip this situation to its Basics you will realize that whenever there is a Nexus demand prices always tend to increase because the sellers of these goods or services would want to maximize on the opportunity but the key here is to identify that the demand itself is fueled by something called as liquidity which in other words is the availability of funds whenever such a situation pans out in the economy as a whole where the demand for goods and services tend to increase and the increase is actually backed by the availability of cash then it is referred to as liquidity lead inflation whenever inflation increases due to excess availability of liquidity in the system the Central Bank in our case The Reserve Bank of India steps in to control the inflation because excess inflation is neither good for the public or the economy but the bigger question to ask is what really leads to a liquidity-led inflation in the very first place let's take a recent example to understand this rewind back to 2020 when covet hit the entire world the public suffered businesses suffered and people lost jobs and people in general were afraid to spend money because of all the uncertainties that prevailed liquidity was tight central banks around the world wanted to inject money into their respective economies so that they could keep their economies floating now how do central banks inject liquidity into the system well one of the easiest way for them to inject liquidity into the system is by controlling the repo and the reverse report rates if you're not familiar with what repo and reverse report rates are I would encourage you to read this chapter on Varsity for a quick understanding when the repo and reverse repo rates are low Banks generally have access to cheaper Capital which they can borrow from the central bank and then in turn lend this at lower rates to the public the public can then borrow funds at lower rates from the bank and then fuel their purchases like Automobiles and homes not just that businesses too can borrow funds at lower rates and can fuel their capital expenditure programs in turn all these expenditures both from the public and the businesses side fuel the economy and helps the economy from not sinking so by lowering the rate Central Bank ensures that they don't let the economy from sinking and they also inject liquidity into the system apart from lowering the monetary rates central banks also participate in open market operations to inject liquidity into the system open market operations are the omo and the government security acquisition program also called the gsap are two Central Bank initiatives using which Central Bank infuses liquidity into the economy the central bank's open market operation is something that you need to understand let me explain like an individual the country too has an income and also has a set of expenses income is mainly in the form of tax Collections and the expense is mainly towards infrastructure and various government initiatives if the income matches the expense then it's all good but its seldom does as in the case of most economies the expenses exceeds the income and in economic terms when the expenses exceed the income it's called a fiscal deficit now to fund the fiscal deficit the Central Bank issues something called as the government bonds where they borrow money from the public and fund the deficit when the liquidity gets tight Central Bank steps in and why are their open market operation they start buying back these bonds from the bank prematurely which implies that the banks are now flushed with liquidity Banks use this liquidity to lend money and pass on the liquidity to Downstream economy by the way the open market purchase of Securities with an intent to flush the system with liquidity is also called as quantitative easing or the QE most people think QE is about printing money it is not to Summit Central Bank inject liquidity into the system by lowering interest rates and also via their open market operations but then excess liquidity for a prolonged period comes with a baggage demand for goods and services go up and as I explained earlier demand fueled by liquidity leads to inflation now when inflation increases the central banks will again have to step in and use the same levers that is the reverse repo repo and open market operations to control inflation and suck all the excess liquidity from the system apart from tweaking the Rapport reverse repo and the open market operations the Central Bank also tweaks something called as the crr or the cash Reserve ratio I've explained what crr is in this chapter of Varsity I would suggest you give it a read all that we've discussed so far is a liquidity-led inflation mainly stemming from the demand side but remember at the start of this video I did mention that inflation is a function of both demand and Supply imbalance let's quickly look at the supply side and how it impacts inflation going back when covet hit us the global supply chain was disrupted there was a shortage of everything which means the commodity prices increased countries producing Commodities holded all these Commodities hoping to release these Commodities at a much higher price you see what's happening here right with shortage of Commodities with the shortage of Supply the price tends to increase and that leads to inflation as well and this is ongoing as we speak the Russia Ukraine war still has a impact on all the Commodities especially oil now when oil prices increase it has a ripple effect on the entire economy including the inflation to sum it up the demand side inflation can be controlled by the Central Bank policies whereas the supply side inflation can be controlled by government policies to control the supply side inflation the government has to step in and take up a series of steps like lowering the duties to make essential Commodities more affordable imposing curves on export so that Commodities are available in domestic markets by the way before I end this video here is how you can keep track of all the important policy rates in the economy so as you see inflation has two sides to it and you as a market participant will have to keep an eye on all these factors and figure how things are panning out in the economy only then will you be in a position to anticipate things in advance and set up better trades I'll see you guys in the next video

rfp_5g7yrTs,1.0,0,everybody keeps talking about inflation but what the heck does it mean inflation inflation inflation inflation is it an underwater animal that looks like a giraffe with backgrounds is it a place you go to on the highway where everything is expensive and it makes you wonder if you should buy a bike is it a thing happening every month that makes every woman go out and every man go so what is inflation and why do people keep talking about it here's some cute bunnies to break it down for you inflation is when a carrot that used to cost one dollar now costs five dollars is when prices are going up it can be because growing carrots is becoming expensive for the farmer so bunnies have to pay the extra cost it can be because governments and banks are printing more banknotes which makes the value of money go down it can be because raccoons and hamsters decide to buy carrots too more people want to buy the same carrots which makes them more valuable and the price goes up basically inflation defines how much money is worth but depending on how high or low it is it can make the same hundred dollar bill buy your yacht a house a pencil or a carrot,0.019,0.887,0.094,0.9513,0.09090909090909091,0.13636363636363635,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.13636363636363635,0.0,0.13636363636363635,0.13636363636363635,0.8043628121419194,0.7851239669421488
I7nPzjvIhiI,1.0,0,[Music] in this video we're talking all about inflation and how Traders can use the inflation studies that we're about to discuss to improve their trading dramatically fundamentals are not something that most retail Traders use but they are incredibly powerful and most hedge fund managers big Traders professionals incorporate some level of fundamentals in their trading in fact most hedge funds rely more on fundamentals than they do on technicals so if the pros are doing that we as regular Traders here on uh you know out in the streets we should try and incorporate some level of fundamentals as well so in this video we're going to talk all about inflation and I'm going to explain it to you in the simplest way I can so that you don't have to go to four years of of Economics to you know college in order to understand the stuff I'm going to try and keep it relatively relatively simple and keep it relevant to a Trader we're not just going to talk economics we're going to talk about how you you as a Trader can tangibly use this information that is so often talked about on tv YouTube you know all sorts of financial Outlets they're talking about inflation constantly so let's get into it inflation explained and notably how to profit from it how can we actually take advantage of understanding the inflation readings and where they may be going next well first of all we need to know what inflation is and to understand that why Traders should care we have to understand kind of what implications the inflation readings of the world have on real world everyday stuff as well as financial markets so inflation is in its simplest form it's the rise in the price of goods and services it actually can be the rise or the fall of price and goods it's like when you go to the store one day and something costs to I don't know ten dollars and the next hit costs you 11. that change in price may not seem like a lot but it is incredibly impactful to the global economy to the local economy to the consumer and all sorts of levels and this has a massive impact on the financial Market because inflation can be you know how many of us have gone to the gas pumps and it's suddenly very very expensive and that hurts your pockets right that impact is massive on financial markets and again we're going to explain it and understand how to benefit from it in this video so it is basically the rise in prices of goods and services I'm talking anything from getting your car filled up with fuel to buying something at the grocery store to renting an apartment all of these things are of course they have goods and services that are priced in a certain way and watching those prices is powerful so another way of thinking about inflation is it's actually the loss of Fiat purchasing power so if the price of stuff is going up what's actually really happening is the value of your dollar or Euro or Canadian dollar or whatever you're using your pound whatever you're using you if prices are going up around you it's not just prices going up what it's really doing is it's really the power of your currency is going down it's losing value and if you looked at any long-term chart maybe we can show something on the screen right now this is the purchasing power of the United States dollar over time and you can see it loses one of the worst long-term Investments you can own is just holding cash under a mattress you know like all those uh you know people who would who would hide their cash into the mattress and think that they're safe well you can't hide from inflation none of us can it's a really powerful force that is pretty persistent in financial markets the last couple hundred years actually for longer than that even back to the Roman times there were periods of elevated inflation anyways that's another history lesson wrong channel for that let's get into of course the uh the concepts here so you can see this this red line here is the price of goods and services and of course the blue line is the Fiat purchasing power and again these things usually move in the opposite direction your currency usually over time becomes value less and again we have to be aware of that but also it has hit big impacts on finance digital markets so why should Traders care so why does this matter to you and I if we're trading each and every day especially if you're a day trader this doesn't matter to you at all right wrong day Traders have a fallacy of thinking that you know economic figures don't impact them but they certainly can create some very strong Trends in the market and knowing what those Trends involve and what they entail from the inflation figures can be very powerful so let's talk about this so TR the reason Traders should care is because these central banks care the Federal Reserve here in the United States the Bank of Canada and Canada the bank of England in the UK the ECB or the European Central Bank these places Watch inflation really really carefully because it can make or break an economy and so central banks have a very strong interest in keeping inflation at or near two percent per year that is the Western Financial thought process that basically around a two percent inflation level is ideal that is a level it will get into why that's so ideal in just a moment but it's a healthy pace of inflation it's not too hot it's not too low and we'll talk about that in just a moment but what you have to understand is that as a Trader the simplest way to understand it is that why should you care the most powerful Financial entities in the world that move markets the most they care tremendously about this topic so to the actions of central banks this this is a really important part here the actions the central banks may take to accomplish this agenda of keeping inflation at a at or around two percent per year uh really moves the markets because what they may do to to uh stop or or uh you know cool or raise inflation is all about the interest rates they can rise interest rates or or let interest rates go down cut rates or hike rates and this has a massive impact on the financial Market we'll talk about that in just a moment so first of all we need to talk about how can we as you know regular people how can we view what inflation is actually looking like well we have what is called the CPI this is the Consumer Price Index and if you've never heard of this the Consumer Price Index is basically a way to track the changes in prices of goods and services over time now the CPI is basically I like to think of it as like a basket of different things picture like a basket with a bunch of item items in it like you have like a Coca-Cola can and a McDonald's you know McFlurry in there I don't know just like a bunch of random things and if we were to track these prices over time within this basket we could check the price of the overall basket over time we could get an idea of what uh broadly speaking prices are doing in the United States or if we're studying this Basket in Canada or the UK we can study their respective CPI basket as well so CPI has several components I've drawn A Little Wheel here and all this is just representing here is what actually makes up the basket of CPI stuff now each one of these are kind of a basket in their own so it's like baskets within a basket kind of thing but basically understand that CPI components at its simplest form involve things like food and beverages uh energy which is like of course like gasoline and things like that housing which is anything from Apartments to home purchases Transportation Medical Care Recreation and other so the reason I point this out to you is that within the CPI lots of different things can impact what the CPI actually turns out to be and the number one thing or another thing you need to know about this is that in red you can see this is the most volatile stuff the most volatile stuff is definitely going to be your food and energy what do I mean by that well these prices fluctuate the most energy if you watch the oil markets going up and down all the time and the price that we pay at the pumps is pretty constantly changing and this has a lot of impact and can very much sway what the CPI is looking like so some uh some some Traders prefer to actually look at the core CPI now the core CPI removes a couple of those very volatile things and looks at some of the more staple Goods to get a more reliable look at what prices are really doing so most volatile gets actually removed you can see they're crossed out so we remove food and energy from the equation to get a better look at what inflation is looking like um now again CPI is a way to measure inflation the reason you need to understand this is because this is how we're going this is what we're going to consult in order to make trading decisions so now that we know what the inflation reading the CPI the Consumer Price Index what that actually is and why it matters we can now talk about with those measurements what do we do with them well we have to understand what these measurements can kind of tell us about the economy and where things are headed so here's the thing when we take a look at inflation in terms of a position what's the positioning of inflation right now I've broken it down to three broadly speaking categories of inflation that I pay attention to the first one here is when CPI is 1.5 percent remember the ideal spot was two percent that's again in terms of like what the Bank of Canada and the bank of England and what the FED they generally speaking they want two percent inflation per year so if things are lower than that if we're seeing for example CPI under 1.5 percent 1.5 or less I like to call this area disinflation this is not a perfect number by the way this is just my educated guess under or at 1.5 percent we're going to call that kind of disinflation and this is actually not good now again remember why two percent why not zero percent well too little inflation is actually tough because um you know I'll show you this this this we're going to jump down to this section here for a second low inflation shows economic recession potentially and a lack of demand and growth because think about it if prices are not being bid up by consumers consistently that shows that there's a lack of demand maybe people aren't buying you know items at the store they're they're saving their money or people aren't renting apartments and bidding up rents obviously that sounds like you know that might be a good thing for you and I and of course you know in some ways it would be but for the economy not so much because that lack of spending and lack of money movement is not so great for an economy again we don't want too much of that either because too much inflation I've marked it as 3.5 percent or more in terms of the CPI uh that is what we call Hot inflation and in 2022 we experienced that quite a bit inflation remained very elevated and in the U.S went up to like nine percent now nine percent is far away from two percent and there was some serious concerns around that so high inflation uh it can lead to Runaway prices which can hurt the economy quite a bit as you can probably imagine runaway prices are no fun for any of us if you're thinking about trying to get a new house or buying a new car anybody trying to get a car during 2022 it was a nightmare the the prices of used cars and new cars they were flying high because consumers were bidding up those prices now sometimes it can actually be like in the case of 2022 we had supply line issues due to the Russia invasion invasion of Ukraine we saw a lot of supply line issues across the board same thing with kova these things cause inflation because a lack of Supply creates a huge amount of demand and everybody rushes for products bidding them up to the heavens it's not fun for consumers and what it actually can do is it actually can lead to an overheating of the economy people are rushing product prices so high that the consumer gets squashed and they can't afford anything and maybe some of you guys might say that sounds a little bit like the United States today and other places of course like you know the UK is experiencing this as well many places are it can be very devastating and this is why the FED wants that inflation not to go too high the last thing they want is to overheat the economy and kill the consumer to the point that there's a massive recession that follows this has happened in the past in the United States uh you know go take a look at some of the times in the previous uh you know decades where we saw very elevated levels of inflation and it led to some really tough years afterwards so will that happen here in the United States right now many people would speculate that that could be the case and that's why in the last few years uh with all this inflation people now have like a slight chance of a recession uh here in the United States that could be pretty devastating due to all the the prices running up so much like they have so the point is high inflation not so good really low inflation not so good sweet spot inflation which I've marked here on this as 1.5 to 3.5 inflation is Comfortably within the realm of what the FED kind of wants it's not perfect 3.5 is pretty high 1.5 still low but I like to call this just generally speaking pretty close to where things have have you know uh kind of gotten back to where the FED wants them during this time here in 2023 2023 has been incredibly bullish year for stocks and I'm I'm going to break this down here what each one of these categories tells us about financial markets because this is the part that is really key if you know how markets generally behave in each one of these categories you can use that to your massive Advantage which is something that I use in my own trading so we'll get into that next so again remember that the fed's goal is to keep moderate inflation with Max employment so how do they do that well here's what they do okay so in this category here the disinflation period what the Federal Reserve has as its tool is interest rates now I'm talking Federal Reserve for the US dollar example if you're in the Bank of England territory you're talking about UK that's a different story we're just talking here as an example in the U.S uh example okay so for the Federal Reserve if they see CPI is you know very low what will they do well they might choose to cut interest rates making borrowing more accessible to businesses and to Consumers who may want to go out and buy a car or buy a house so in this case fed May cut rates okay in this case that has some implications on the market we'll talk about that in just a second in the middle spot Sweet Spot the FED is pretty content they may in this case fed May hold they might just be good to keep interest rates at that level again they raise interest rates to slow the economy down they cut interest rates to speed the economy up this is their measurement this is again Western philosophy of how financial markets can work uh and then next let's talk about the last one which is of course high levels of inflation the FED May hike interest rates okay so this is what we saw if you're watching this video relatively recently to when I want to record this in 2022 and 2023 we've sent a lot of rate hikes because inflation has been on the upper limits of this it's been very hot inflation in the last year and a half well the FED does what they raise rates to try and keep things under control next up we've got to talk about how to trade it and this is really key because in the case of using this information there's three different categories that I've broken down and three different ways to look at them in a disinflation environment where things are really slow this in my opinion and and studying traditionally kind of Market sentiment this is generally speaking in a really low period This is a scary time this is recession this is fear in the world this is uncertainty if central banks and economies will be able to survive all that good stuff not so good it's like 2008 this is terrible right it's a really really tough time the this generally speaking can be a really positive scenario for gold and silver as people may be very very fearful of what's going to happen and move out of the dollar move out of stocks and go into something good old-fashioned like gold and silver this is also a time where maybe other currencies like the Japanese Yen or other stronger currencies out there may look more attractive relative to our US dollar example here so again uh it's bullish for gold for silver other currencies that look stronger and healthier and finally also bonds bonds typically do well during recession as people may um you know think that rate cuts are coming and again bonds trade heavily based on what interest rates are going to do and so as we'll speak about probably in a future video about interest rates this is a really important thing by the way if you're enjoying the video do me a quick favor hit that Thumbs Up Button And subscribe if you're new we have more videos like this coming these are a lot of work to put together so if you do enjoy these types of videos again help us out hit that thumbs up button for the algorithm okay finally we also have bearish stuff in a disinflationary environment where inflation is very low or possibly shrinking stocks and indices don't look great because again this is showing that the demand in the economy is really low and low demand is probably not going to do well for companies who are really struggling finally we also have the US dollar down or bearish because people are probably not going to be too confident in the US dollar when the economy is totally slowing up and again bond prices are going up yields are going down people are very concerned think about it this way dollar not so good in a disinflationary environment so something to think about there the next category is talking about The Sweet Spot when inflation is at what the Federal Reserve probably deems a pretty healthy zone or at least close to that two percent Target this environment is totally different than the first one and the last one in this case we're actually in my opinion this is where you want to be very bullish stocks and indices and equities and things like that like this is the period where if things look confident things look okay the fed's not going to raise interest rates on you and you're economy looks pretty strong all of these things great time to buy stocks and indices personally one of my favorite styles and timings to trade stocks and indices is in The Sweet Spot environment in fact we briefly have kind of come back closer to that area since 2022's Mayhem and it's been a really great year for me in 2023 trading primarily stocks and indices uh you know during kind of coming back into a little bit more of a sweet spot will it stay there we'll see again things are still developing every day but anyways the next thing is of course during this period of time we also see uh non-usd currencies doing well because again this is kind of an optimistic time and foreign investment might be elevated and other currencies might do pretty well because in this spot the what drives the US dollar higher is a lot of times it's rising interest rates and a red-hot economy so in this case the US dollar is not really necessarily like full on bearish but it's definitely not full-on bullish so I'd say it's closer to bearish during this category and so is gold because gold typically does well in fearful environments or in highly inflationary environments so both of those situations are not the case here in The Sweet Spot because during The Sweet Spot we're seeing things uh kind of normalized and doing very well overall and gold typically doesn't do well in confident Market environments usually uh that's that's there's a little there should be a little asterisk next to that because it's not perfect science with any of this stuff there's other factors than just inflation for sure this is just kind of a lens of inflation to consider in your toolbox finally hot inflation hot inflation is pretty much just bullish for the US dollar if you take a look at the 2022 year the dollar just screamed higher all year long and it was because interest rates were going up and up and up because inflation was going up and up and up and the Fed was trying to combat that rise in inflation by raising the interest rates in the United States so the point is US dollar typically does very good during that time on the bearish side pretty much everything stocks don't look so great like they didn't look great in 2022. non-usd currencies like the Euro the pound everything against the dollar typically will fall in a very hot inflation area where the FED is is you know on the door knocking and raising rates those things are going to put a lot of pressure on the dollar to the upside and of course that means other currencies may do less well and finally bonds typically don't do well because Rising interest rates make current bonds or old bonds previously issued bonds less attractive to investors because why buy a bond at two percent when it looks like interest rates are going to go up to three percent I might just wait and buy a bond once interest rates get much higher so that's why bonds can be a very important Market as well we've probably got another video coming on bonds lots of stuff here so make sure to subscribe if you have not already okay guys so I wanted to show you something on the edge finder which is our team's Market data software where we can take a look at some inflation figures and what you'll notice is that there's all sorts of different major economies and their respective inflation here reported and if you take a look at the blue line that's going to be our US dollar uh related inflation so of course when it comes to inflation we've been we saw a very high spike in inflation during 20 22 and in 2023 we saw a decline in inflation well one thing when it comes to scoring and adding in inflation to my trading strategy is I want to take into account what is going on with particular currencies in our top setups algorithm so if you're not familiar with the edge finder what this tool does is it takes into account tons of different Market data specifically to this video talking about inflation the edge finder automatically pulls in the latest inflation statistics and then what it does is it actually scores and ranks all the different assets on the far left so one thing that we often hear from people who are using our tools are you know they want to use fundamentals in their trading like you know growth and inflation and unemployment and interest rates and use all that information to better their trading but it's a lot of work to keep up with and to check all this stuff so the edge finder does a pretty cool thing it takes into account all of this data and it pretty much ranks and files things for you so every everything that we're talking about in this video is pretty much accounted for the way I explained it is accounted for in the edge finder where it takes into account inflation as well as many other key metrics scores the totals and gives us biases so one thing that you'll notice here is that when we're looking at the euro versus the dollar the pound versus the dollar what we're seeing is recently the inflation in the United States has spiked back up again pointing towards a bullish reading on the dollar now remember as we've gone in this video so far uh talking about inflation Rising is bullish for the currency because the Central Bank may be more likely to act and so we're getting certain readings and part of that waiting is coming directly from our inflation study that we're talking about so you can directly see how the lessons that we're discussing in this video are in in fact certainly being reflected in the scoring algorithm from the edge finder which is for me personally where I find the trades that I am taking so inflation as well as other things are playing a serious waiting into which trades I am actually looking to take on what particular assets for example right now at the time of recording this we know inflation is ticking up well that inflation reading uh is pointing towards a slightly more bearish reading for gold as the dollar may become more attractive and put downward pressure on the gold market if you'd like access to the edge finder again you can find more information Down Below in the description so now that you guys have seen a little bit of our software tool that we use to calculate and monitor inflation automatically I want to tell you

Sg2Xqd8kx_U,1.0,0,while the world comes out of economic recession due to the pandemic a lot of things are changing high inflation stimulus packages interest rates all these words are popping up on the news but it's hard to figure out how does the whole system work in this video we explain all of that and more let's start with hyperinflation inflation is the rate that shows how much the price for goods and services rise a low inflation rate is the norm in most countries around the world the u.s inflation rate for example in 2019 was 2.3 percent in the euro zone 1.3 percent the american economist philip kagan was the first to classify hyper inflation he stated that the phenomenon happens when a country's inflation rate exceeds 50 percent per month there are different reasons this happens even though each case is unique there are common patterns for example in most cases the economy is already weak and there is a shock caused by war international isolation or natural disasters the road to hyperinflation usually comes after a chain of events and it usually happens as follows tax revenues are drastically reduced the reason can be external factors like war a sudden change in commodities prices or country specific reasons like political transition bad monetary policies and even corruption the government starts printing money the supply of money pushes inflation up the rise impacts government revenues the country experiences a period of high inflation affecting the government's budget and confidence in its institutions the government then prints more money and resorts to measures that fail to control inflation the inflation rate accelerates the currency value collapses inflation explodes country experiences hyperinflation before the first world war cases of hyperinflation were rare prices rose during the french revolution and american civil war but hyperinflation is mostly a modern phenomenon the following ranking was created by economists steve hankey and nicholas cruz so here we go let's see which countries produce the five worst cases of hyperinflation in the last 100 years number five greece this is greece the country that gave us democracy philosophers and probably the world's earliest currency units the drachma it is also the country that experienced the fifth worst case of hyperinflation in history the worst month was october 1944 when the inflation rate was 13 800 percent the new york times reported that month that one dollar was worth 300 million drachmas in the port of patras to understand how the situation got that bad it is important to go back four years the country was occupied by the axis forces during the second world war the new government added to its expenses the support of its army which had approximately four hundred thousand soldiers this expense represented between one-third to three-fifths of all the country's expenditures during that time and notes advanced from the greek bank paid the bill when the occupation ended tax revenues covered only six percent of total expenditures another point of instability that contributed to the hyperinflation was the government's policy of paying with gold sovereigns a british gold coin this reduced public trust in the economy and added uncertainty to the situation in 1940 a british gold coin could be exchanged for 1100 drachma by december 1944 it could be exchanged for 19.9 trillion drachma in october 1944 the exiled greek government returned and implemented plans to curtail inflation the country continued to be plagued with political instability internal conflicts and other difficulties post-war greece was marked by other inflationary periods the country joined the european union in 1981 and adopted the euro in 2001 since then inflation remains under control number 4 germany one of the most famous hyperinflation periods in history happened in germany during the weimar republic events took a dramatic turn in october 1923 when wholesale prices increased by 29 500 percent a loaf of bread in 1922 cost 163 marks by september 1923 the price had increased to 1.5 billion in november it was 200 billion the situation got so extreme that people were paid out at an hourly basis workers rushed to stores to secure food and produce before prices soared again the prices doubled every 3.7 days on average it was normal to see people carrying money in wheelbarrows restaurants stopped displaying menus it was pointless by the time a person finished eating prices had gone up salaries and pensions lost their value fast a university teacher an esteemed position in society that came with a respectable salary could no longer feed his family a combination of factors led to this nightmare after the first world war the country had to shoulder the blame for starting the conflict pay exorbitant reparations relinquish control of colonies and territories and limit the size of its army all of this would already be a source of destabilization but there was more germany had used bonds to fund the war the plan was to conquer territories and pay the debt back with the conquered money but in reality the new republic was created already with a colossal debt resulting from pre-war bonds some economists estimate that it was probably around 175 percent of the gdp with no option of a bailout quite the opposite germany needed to pay reparations to the other countries in hard currency the government then started printing money to pay its debt and to buy foreign currency the more it printed the more the currency tanked and inflation rose people realized money had lost its value and rushed to spend this created a vicious circle in 1914 a dollar was valued at around 4.2 marks by november 1923 the exchange rate for a single us dollar was 4.2 trillion marks the situation was stabilized somewhat by a new currency backed with hard assets in 1924 but by then millions of middle-class germans had lost their savings this period was so traumatic that some people say to this day it still haunts the public and continues to be an influential factor in the country's debt aversion number three yugoslavia taking third place on the podium the bronze medal goes to the federal republic of yugoslavia in the first month of 1994 the inflation rate rose 313 million percent during this time you would be able to buy a loaf of bread with a 500 million dinar note that's it just one the situation got so crazy that the cost of a pack of cigarettes in the morning would be the equivalent of one cigarette in the evening the money value was so high that the government kept introducing new plans to cut the zeros it didn't work the situation continued to deteriorate on january 1st 1994 the government knocked nine zeros off the notes with a monetary plan by the last week of the same month it had already printed a 10 million dinar note to understand how this happened we need to look at the disintegration of the former socialist republic of yugoslavia from june 1991 to march 1992 slovenia croatia macedonia and bosnia-herzegovina declared independence the remaining two countries serbia and montenegro formed what was called the federal republic of yugoslavia the war that followed independence led to international sanctions which include a trade embargo the country relied heavily on imports and the effects of sanctions had a huge impact on the economy the country had four regional central banks in addition to the official one all of them some of them illegally conducted credit provisions and issued dinar notes without oversight the newly formed federal republic had also two outside republics formed by ethnic serbian majorities republica srpska in bosnian herzegovina and the republic of serbian cryina in croatia these two republics also went through hyperinflation periods with similar magnitude the republican serbsca for example had an inflation rate of 297 million percent in january 1994. later in 1994 the government created a new monetary plan with a new currency backed by the german mark after that inflation decreased to double-digit levels in annual terms which persisted for years following montenegro's independence in 2006 the country ceased to exist number 2. zimbabwe the silver medal goes to the most recent case on our list zimbabwe the african country had the world's second highest inflation in the first of the 21st century in november 2008 the prices increased 79.6 billion percent a bag of sugar cost about 90 billion zimbabwe dollars and salaries of unskilled workers were around 200 billion that was the equivalent of 10 a month 150 billion zimbabwean dollars got you 20 eggs and an average retirement pension paid out 130 billion which at one point was worth less than one dollar to understand what led to this we need to understand history after years of fighting between the white regime and black nationalists zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 robert mugabe emerged as a national leader and was able to consolidate his powers during his government he moved toward an authoritarian regime of one party rule and joined the first congo war in 1990 and the second in 1998. in 2000 he promoted the fast track land reform program which seized wide-owned land without any compensation ignoring a former joint effort with the british government to make that possible the central bank started lending directly to new farmers to finance the operations this led to farmers being replaced by inexperienced sometimes first-time landowners together with the impact of severe droughts agricultural production and exports declined significantly as a result the economy stagnated food shortages and riots started to take place the involvement in the wars and accusations of human rights violations raised international criticism and the country became increasingly isolated all the uncertainty had a profound effect on the foreign investments which fell from 400 million dollars in 1998 to 30 million dollars in 2007 since its independence there was no year that the government had a balanced budget and never a surplus when inflation accelerated the government tried measures like redenomination of the currency limiting on money withdrawal and a price freeze hyperinflation followed and the population moved to foreign currencies which exacerbated the situation in 2009 the country created a multi-currency dollarization system that replaced the zimbabwe dollar although it calmed the situation for a while until today even after mugabe's deposition via a coup in 2017 there are still reports that the inflation rate is above 50 percent in the country number one hungary hungary experienced after the second world war what is to this day the world record in inflation the country had an inflation rate of 4.19 quadrillion percent in july 1946 historians recall that the famous hungarian poet george falooti was paid 300 billion pego by his publisher with the money he was able to buy one chicken one liter of olive oil and a few vegetables at a local budapest market during this time prices were doubling every 15 hours with such high inflation people started to rely on the black market the desperation of the government was so big that it imposed the death penalty for dealings in black market trade in 1945 a note with a face value of 100 quintillion pego was issued until today no banknote with a higher denomination was ever issued the roots of this nightmare are in the war damage lack of reserves reparations costs of occupation among other reasons after the war the situation was catastrophic in total economists estimate that 40 percent of hungary's non-human wealth was destroyed this had a huge effect on the production capacity and put pressure on prices the soviets signed the armistice with hungary and set reparation costs at 300 million dollars which included the removal of equipment the hungarians also had to pay for soviet troops stationed in the country according to estimates hungary's after war bill was between 600 and 900 million dollars with a huge deficit and isolated hungary had no other option than printing money it printed so much that currency circulation passed from 25 billion pango in july 1945 to 1.6 trillion by january 1946 reached 65 quadrillion by may and 47 septillion pango by july 1946 in 1947 the hungarian government announced a reform created a new currency and stipulated rules such as new central bank regulations to government loans prices started falling and went back to normal in the following months as we saw hyperinflation happens when a government loses control of its economy next we will see how the system works and how is this possible since officially abandoning the gold standard in 1973 the dollar is what economists call fiat money the word fiat comes from latin and is often translated as a decree but in summary the term means that the money is not backed by a physical asset like gold or silver pretty much every currency in the world is fiat money and their value fluctuates in relation to each other having a currency with no backing makes it easier to control the supply of money for example this is helpful in moments of crisis and recession when the government's resort to measures to inject money and revive the economy where there's an upside there are also downsides some see this as the disadvantages of the system to understand both sides of this problem let's take a closer look at where the trillions of dollars that are part of corona relief packages come from to afford this amount of money the government needs to increase its debts dramatically one of the ways of doing that is issuing bonds government bonds are debt securities an instrument used to raise money and support spending obligations bonds are basically a document in which a lender like a bank agrees to lend money to the government and in return the debt can be repaid at a later date with interest depending on the country the bonds are issued in they vary on interest rates and dates that need to be repaid in the case of the united states the treasury department sells the issued bonds during auctions throughout the year issuing bonds is a standard procedure in normal circumstances there is a market to absorb the bonds without a big fuss but when we are talking about sudden trillions of dollars things are not that simple and the role played by the federal reserve also known as fed is what makes things controversial in theory the fed is independent and its main goal is to promote maximum employment stable prices and manage long-term interest rates in the united states but in extraordinary cases such as the relief packages the fed also functions as a buyer buying most of the government bonds issued in the first corona relief package during donald trump's presidency the fed signaled its willingness to essentially buy an unlimited amount of government debt the fed is not allowed to buy bonds directly from the government it needs to buy on what is called open market operations it can be bought from the so-called primary dealers this includes the big banks and brokers like jp morgan goldman sachs and others for example once the fed buys the equivalent of one trillion dollars in bonds from these institutions it injects the same amount of money into the bank reserves facilitates lending and increases the money supply and circulation it's direct money being injected into the economy money that didn't exist until the fed bought the bonds moreover the fed is no ordinary bond holder by law it has to pay its profits to the treasury at the end of the day when the treasury pays interest on bonds this money generated by bonds that becomes a profit goes back to the government at the same time that the fed acts on open market operations it also cuts its benchmark interest rate reducing the cost of borrowing when businesses and people borrow more it also increases the amount of money in circulation for the critics these measures to stimulate the economy are just loopholes in the system an unofficial way of an endless supply of money without actually printing it there is risk to long-term stability and can lead to inflation devaluation of the dollar and eventually collapse of the economy but is the fed over stimulating the economy with open market operations to understand the situation it's possible to look into the fed's balance sheet which consists of assets like bonds and liabilities owned by the bank the total amount went from 4.1 trillion dollars in the last week of february 2020 to 7.5 trillion in the first week of february 2021 not all of these are government bonds but this number gives us an idea of how much the fed has been acting during this crisis since the dollar is fiat money there are no limits to issue debt and also no limits for the fed to act and buy the bonds supplying the government with more money and more dollars available can also affect its value if the united states had a currency backed by something the fed would not be able to expand the money supply to such an excessive amount for example if the fed tried to do that while on the gold standard it would cause the dollar value to fall due to oversupply compared to its gold parity and compromise the basis of the system for the pessimists this is putting us on a trajectory of crisis and the collapse is inevitable so again in a nutshell this is how the cycle of collapse would work everything starts with the currency backed by a physical asset in the dollar case until 1973 it was gold the precious mineral gave value to currency and created a level of confidence that led to the expansion of commerce and credit but with the currency attached to gold there is a limit on how much credit is possible to generate plus the system is affected by the amount of gold mined in the world and very exposed to speculation as the country needs to always keep currency value in parity with the gold reserves this limitation led to the idea that gold backing the dollar was not beneficial the country then leaves the system the fiat model comes in through a decree remember what fiat means what follows is euphoria the system is flooded with liquidity stimulus packages increasing spending in many areas increase in trade this leads to abuse government starts spending more than it should and monetizes even more of its debts to fund its obligations slowly the economic growth starts to decline and confidence starts to fade inflation begins rising all confidence is lost hyperinflation follows and the economy collapses a new government creates a new system with a new currency backed by a physical asset the cycle begins anew critics believe we are at a stage where the government is starting to lose its confidence inflation inevitably will start to rise and be followed by hyperinflation and collapse but is there any truth behind this pessimist view well there isn't a consensus but it's fair to say that the majority of economists would disagree with the forecast one of the most critical of these views is nobel prize laureate and new york times columnist paul krugman as proof that pessimism is unfounded he points to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis from the start of the economic crisis until 2014 the fed's balance sheet also grew exponentially more than four trillion dollars and still inflation stayed low krugman believes that the risks aren't greater now he believes that for the most part the funds that the fed injected into the economy simply piled up either in the bank reserves or in cash held by individuals and are not harmful the fed's latest bond buying spree is an evolution of what began finding acceptance considered normal during the 2008 financial crisis ben bernanke former chair of the fed during that time also hit back at the critics for him what the fed was doing wasn't printing money to finance government borrowing but a temporary measure that would be reversed eventually the fed sells the bonds it acquired and things go back to normal although they believe the practice isn't harmful to the economy long term it's important to point out the growing level of debt in the united states according to the congressional budget office 2020 was the first year since 1946 that the country's debt exceeded the size of the entire economy the u.s had a total debt held by the public of 21 trillion the equivalent of 100.1 percent of gdp by 2021 the country is projected to hold 22.4 trillion dollars in debt 102.3 percent of gdp they also project that the debt will represent 107 percent of gdp by 2031 when it should surpass 35.3 trillion dollars does that mean that there is no way out of the crisis and a collapse is about to happen it's impossible to predict but generally speaking there are no signs that the financial market is worried about the growing deficit the fact is despite the huge debt the u.s government is not financially constrained it has no problem borrowing money in borrowing is very cheap with the 10-year interest rate barely above one percent funnily enough the market sees this as a positive sign and the country would be able to keep going and borrowing forever under the current circumstances moreover with expected 3.7 percent gdp growth in the next decade any debt would tend to melt away as a share of gdp over time for now it seems like the full faith and credit of the united states is more than enough for investors we will have to wait and see for how long how would the economy be if we still have the gold standard would we be better or worse off let's take a look every once in a while the gold standard goes back into fashion the world has moved on from currencies attached to the precious metal for fifty years but discussions around the topic are more vivid than ever to understand why going back to the gold standard is still appealing to some people we need to dive into what are the disadvantages and advantages of the system the biggest argument pro gold standard has to do with safety and stability one can argue that gold retains a stable value to the currency and this theoretically could reduce the risk of instability and economic crises with a fixed asset backing the money's value governments wouldn't be able to raise their debts without first buying more gold for some people especially those who worry about hyper inflation and do not trust governments or central banks the gold standard is a great tool to legally curb government spending and the money supply into society according to this thought with the currency attached to limited physical assets like gold the risks of debt spiraling out of control followed by inflationary periods are smaller and long-term stability safety and prosperity would follow supporters of the gold standard believe that the system does not allow the government to resort to expansionary measures as it seems fit or what critics usually say simply print more money to finance new debt and let's be honest the us debt problem is getting bigger by the day at the end of 2020 the us government debt held by the public was at more than 21 trillion dollars a little bit more than the whole gdp as a comparison that's much more than what the country owns in gold the u.s gold reserves were valued at 11 trillion dollars by the end of 2020 if we look at the historical graph of united states debt since 1966 we can clearly see a path look at it here that's when the country left the gold standard now check what happened next some believe that if the united states continues down this path the result will inevitably be a severe crisis in the years to come and the solution for that might rest on going back to the gold standard but for some things are not as simple as gold standard defenders believe no one disagrees that the u s fiscal situation is challenging but having the currency tied to gold would change some of the most basic fundamentals of the current monetary policy in the ongoing system the federal reserve can respond to financial crises in many ways among many measures it can lower interest rates during a recession raise the rates during an inflationary period or it can buy or sell government bonds and inject money into the economy when necessary and this flexibility to act according to the situation was very important in the last decade during the 2008 financial crash or 2020 covet crisis the fed has resorted to expansionary measures in both cases if the currency were still pegged to gold the fed's actions would be limited and one can only imagine both the social and economic impacts that might have incurred on the gold standard system the focus of any monetary policy would be diverted away from ensuring economic stability to maintaining an exchange rate target with gold being the most important aspect of the economy the country's need to keep its reserves intact becomes the focal point of the central banks more than providing an ideal business scenario fighting unemployment or raising productivity also making exchange rate adjustments would be more difficult and the government would have to resort to alternatives like protectionist measures higher tariffs import quotas or exchange control the results of this could harm economies around the world and affect global trade another negative aspect of the gold standard that is not very often discussed would be environmental damage gold is a scarce mineral increased demand for gold would mean that mining activity would also increase very often on indigenous lands around the world the impacts of this could be devastating okay back to the question of how the economy would look like when we still have the dollar pegged to gold three economists have a possible answer to this question through a quantitative method they calculate how the u s economy would have performed if the dollar was still pegged to the gold between two thousand and twenty twenty the results are not very good for the gold standard advocates for example the researchers found that the shocks on gold supply and demand would have a greater negative effect on the economy than any other shocks that have happened such as an economic crisis if the gold standard was still in place during this period we would have an increase in economic volatilities and a deterioration of the household welfare basically the speed at which gold is mined introduces a lot of randomness to monetary policy the fed would have to set interest rates to maintain a fixed dollar price of gold rather than to target inflation as it is today for example in moments of crisis people spend less and investors purchase more gold a safe haven investment in this case the central bank would have to increase the interest rate to make other assets more attractive and control the price of the mineral if the reverse happens and for some reason there is more gold in the world the central bank would have to lower the interest rate in the end the monetary decision would not be rational or based on facts and estimations but more a matter of faith or a belief on what could happen to the gold situation in the world in summary an economy based on how much gold is mined around the world would be let's say probably more unstable but is it even reasonable to consider a transition back to gold standard well it depends who you ask for some it would be a big mess but not impossible for starters the united states would not be able to go back to the gold standard alone due to trade and money supply it would be very complicated for the us to do this alone otherwise countries that own large chunks of u.s debt like china for example could just ask for their dollars to be exchanged for gold in theory that would not be a problem but and that's a big but if every debt holder does the same the us probably won't have enough gold in its reserve to pay it all back yes the numbers don't match so if it wants to go down this path the us would have to pump its gold reserves or the gold price would have to be set so high and the dollar would be so devalued that inflation would follow and trade would possibly crash that's the scenario that critics of the gold standard believed to happen if an attempt to go back would take place but defenders do not agree with that in the end the gold standard is not as unusual as some people want to believe it's just a fixed valued system according to the imf many countries around the world have their currencies somehow linked to an external standard typically the euro or the dollar for a country going back to the gold standard would be more of the same and not that crazy and if these views were once restricted to the fringes it really made it to the mainstream in the last years the republican party called for a commission to investigate the viability of going back to the gold standard on the campaign platforms of 2012 and 2016 a bill to establish a commission to look into the feasibility of the gold standard was approved in the house of representatives in 2015 and 2017 but never managed to get approved in the senate alexander mooney a representative from west virginia even proposed the full-on return to the gold standard on a bill that never got co-sponsors and never happened in 2020 when then president donald trump appointed judy shelton a longtime gold standard advocate to a seat on the federal reserve's board of governors everyone thought that shelton would finally get to the front seat of monetary policy makers the nomination got stuck in the senate and never happened but shelton's ideas were put under the spotlight in the past she had called for a new bretton woods conference referencing the 1944 meeting that established the post-war economic order to understand exactly what a new bretton woods would mean today we need to go back in time and look into the origins of the first one the road to breton woods was paved by policies and choices from way before the conference in 1900 the gold standard act made the policy official in the united states the gold dollar was then declared the standard unit and all forms of money issued by the government were to be maintained at parity with it after the first world war countries started experimenting leaving the gold standard and printing more money to save their economies the united states kept the gold standard after the crash of 29 investors started trading commodities in currencies looking for safer investments and the price of gold rose a hoarding phenomenon spread in the united states affecting the country's gold reserves in 1933 u s president franklin delano roosevelt issued an executive order for bidding hoarding and the gold reserve act was signed in 1934 with the forbidding people were allowed to keep just the equivalent of one hundred dollars and everything else needed to be returned to the state the gold reserve act would lead to the creation of the reserves at fort knox in 1936 the legendary u.s gold depository in kentucky where 143 million ounces of gold are kept at the moment fast forward to the last year of the second world war representatives of 44 countries gathered in july 1944 in breton woods a resort place in new hampshire to organize what would be the post-war monetary system it was also in the same event that the ideas of the international monetary fund and the world bank initially focused only on reconstruction were forged the americans arrived at bretton woods in a very strong position with reserves of 20 000 metric tons of gold roughly 60 percent of the world's total they advocated for fixed conversion rates assured by a dollar tied to gold the brits heavily in debt and broke after the war were hoping for flexible exchange rates to revive exports but the americans feared post-war inflation in the end the americans had their way after the agreement the countries were to keep their currencies fixed but adjustable to the dollar which was pegged to gold at 35 an ounce it was only by 1959 however that the system started operating as agreed in bretton woods up to this point countries maintained fixed exchange rates in relation to the dollar by buying their currency in exchange markets when too low or increasing the supply of money when too high during the sixties a surplus of dollars caused by foreign aid military spending due to the vietnam war and foreign investment made it almost impossible for the united states to keep the value of the gold at 35 presidents tried to control the gold price with actions like restrictions on foreign lending this resulted in the nation's foreign trading position being damaged for the overvalued dollar in 1971 then president richard nixon announced that the united states would no longer buy gold to maintain the price at thirty five dollars and halted the convertibility which meant that countries could no longer redeem dollars,0.115,0.782,0.103,-0.9989,0.09666666666666666,0.14,0.035555555555555556,0.18777777777777777,0.09444444444444444,0.11666666666666667,0.07222222222222222,0.25666666666666665,0.9359182027863738,0.8409061728395062
ZLv636OxgL4,1.0,0,hey everyone with all the talk of inflation in the news i thought it would be prudent to do a quick video on a common measure of inflation namely the consumer price index or cpi but first what is inflation inflation is where the general prices of goods and services increase deflation on the other hand is when they decreased for instance due to inflation the price of a loaf of bread in the uk in 1975 was 16p in 2021 it is around 160. as prices rise this means that the currency's purchasing power decreases using the same example 106 p nowadays could buy you six and a half loaves of bread back in 1975 whereas now it can only get you one so why does this happen well it happens because the price of raw materials production and salaries to make and sell that loaf of bread rise over time inflation can also happen as the demand for certain goods rise more demand than supply means an increase in the price of supply now people politicians economics need a way to quantify and measure this rate of inflation and as such have developed ways to do this so let's talk about cpi one of the common measures cpi is a theoretical basket of everyday goods each with an average price tag now there are hundreds of everyday goods and services that are tracked and they are split into eight categories namely housing clothing transport food and drink medical care recreation education and other examples within these categories might include the price of a carton of milk a loaf of bread rent a pair of shoes electricity and so on these also depend what country you are from the basket of goods in the uk will be different from the basket of goods in the us and this basket is also dependent on the times in which we live for example in 2020 hand sanitizer was added to this list cpi is always measured against a base year so if the average cost of a basket in 2021 is 5 pound 20 and the average cost of that same basket in 2020 is 5 pound ten the increase is five pound twenty divided by five pound ten times a hundred which is one point zero one nine or simply one one point nine percent rise cpi helps determine the purchasing power of a currency and consequently the rate of inflation the government here in the uk aims to keep inflation at the two percent level the general view is that if inflation is too high or changes a lot it's hard for businesses to set the right prices for their products and for people to plan their spending on the other hand if it is too low then people might not spend as much as they expect prices to fall which stops the economy from growing having said that the reason why everyone is talking about it now is that inflation in the uk is now as high as 5.1 percent now when we talk in terms of loaves of bread it's hard to see how a five percent rise in prices is impactful in the everyday however it really is and is something everyone needs to take seriously let's take a broad example say in 2021 you receive a net salary of 30 000 pounds a year and your cost of living bills rent car etc comes to around twenty thousand pounds a year so you manage to put ten thousand pounds away in savings on a five percent inflation rate your cost of living in one year's time in 2022 will essentially be 21 000 pounds now if your salary doesn't go up accordingly to match inflation then now you're only saving 9 000 pounds a year and this goes on and on so why is inflation so high at the moment well there are a number of reasons but it's mostly due to the global pandemic energy price increases and the varying supply supply chain disruption leading to less supply than demand as a whole which puts upward pressure on the prices so what has the government done well in order to try and lessen the effects of inflation two days ago the bank of england decided to raise interest rates to 0.25 from its all-time low of 0.1 percent so what does this do generally interest rates and inflation rates have an inverse relationship if interest rates are low more people can borrow money to spend the economy grows and inflation increases if interest rates are high people tend to save more because returns from savings are greater this means they don't spend as much the economy slows and inflation decreases so a higher interest rate basically is trying to decrease the demand of the demand supply relationship which we spoke about before i hope that makes sense it is important to note that cpi is not the only measure of inflation in the uk we also have an adjustment cpi known as cpih which includes home occupies housing costs this means the theoretical basket includes all the costs associated with owning maintaining and living in one's own home there is also an older measure of inflation called the retail price index as as well as the wholesale price index but i'll perhaps go into those in other videos i hope this gives you a starting overview of cpi inflation and interest rates if you enjoyed this video please do subscribe to my channel and comment below if you have any thoughts take care everyone i'll see you all soon

DFCslu5jVKo,1.0,0,let's get into the tokenomics of seoul the native token to the solana blockchain tokenomics and cryptocurrency is extremely important well let's look at the supply let's look at different inflation rates let's look at what's going on knowing these things understanding when you're investing in cryptocurrency is extremely important this is not financial advice do not take any of my advice when investing in cryptocurrencies this is just for information educational purposes only let's uh get right into this so here we're on coin gecko and we have our circulating supply and we have our total supply what's interesting with solana is there are quite a few blockchains that have max supplies and then there's the circulating supply uh however with solana there is technically no max supply so the inflation can happen and definitely i'm gonna go over the inflation rates and what that's looking like but it is interesting because there is kind of two different inflation rates now looking at circulating supply that is going to be all the tokens that are actually on the that are on the blockchain that are able to be traded and used and staked and all these things the total supply is this number that is quite vague so let's look more at the solana tokenomics this uh graph here you've probably already seen and this is actually a big point that people who do not like seoul uh look at this allocation of solana of seoul tokens and as you can see a lot of the tokens went to foundations seed sales investors the team not as many went out into the retail market and to investors like you and me which makes people say that seoul seems more centralized and less decentralized which is quite true probably is more centralized but anyways so we had 20 to the foundation 25 of the seed sale 20 to the uh founding sale strategic sale 3 to strategic sale 8.2 to validator sale public auction sale was only 2.6 so that is very low if we look here at the initial token distribution of seoul so there is this chart here of the sole supply schedule it gives you an idea here from december 20th this is basically when all the tokens were issued these are all the different amounts here this is all basically the uh what you would call the centralized group of holders here and then this green part here is going to be your staking rewards inflation and says by november 32 we're gonna have a this is the total supply this doesn't necessarily mean the total circulation of solana which i think to me the circulating amount is more important because that's actually what is being traded and bought and sold and such so here it's stating by november 2032 we will have 800 million total supply of sold these here were your funding rounds 3.17 million was raised in a seed 2018 at 40 cents uh 12 million was raised at 20 cents another 5 million was raised at 22 cents back in 2019 1.8 million was raised in 2020 for 22 cents so these early investors got in extremely early and if you've been in seoul for a little bit you saw the pump last year up to the high 200s they made crazy crazy crazy returns if they sold if they sold we don't know for sure now what is something that's good to know is i wanted to see when these tokens were able to be sold or dumped on the open market to see if there is a date that we might be waiting for that the supply could spike now from uh masari.io most of the information here is stating around january 7 2021 the majority of these pre-seed these seed sales these investor sales became unlocked so those have already been unlocked and have been able to be sold on the market how much those were sold we don't necessarily know there's a 12.5 percent here that was issued to founders allocation this won't be fully unlocked and vested until january 2023 but it will be vested monthly so they can sell increments of this sole on the open market now there was a grant pool you have 35 million community reserve tokens uh in 5 million token increments this was unlocked january 2021. so it looks like the majority of these early investors have been able to sell since january of 2021 so that date has already passed uh how much they still hold we don't know for sure but this is good to look at now the thing that i wanted to look into is the inflation inflation to me is extremely important when investing in currencies and the us dollar has crazy inflation right now and a lot of these crypto currencies especially the proof of stake have inflation when you look up salon inflations these are the quick numbers you find the initial inflation rate is eight percent the disinflation rate is 15 so supposedly the inflation is supposed to decrease by 15 every single year until we get to the long-term inflation rate of 1.5 percent annually with no max now that is the inflation rate of the total supply that is not the inflation of the circulating supply so let's go over this uh proposed inflation schedule this will vary based on the amount of solana that is locked or staked on the network so annual inflation this date here is as of january 20 or sorry january 25 2020 and this will be this will show each year the inflation rate of the total supply of solana will decrease over a 10-year period where 10 years so that would be 2030 we'll have a total supply inflation of 1.5 percent this is going to be the number of total supply so we basically started out at 500 million uh total supply of solana and in 15 years we'll be up at 750 million total solana tokens now if we look here at example staked yield so see if you look at this graph here it shows you how there's an annual staking yield percentage and that's either more or less depending on how much is staked for soul so say only sixty percent of soul is staked you're going to have a 13 annual yield if 90 percent of soul of staked you're going to have an 8 annual yield however most uh staking wallets you'll see last time i checked we were getting about six percent on solano so you want to be staking your solana to help combat a bit with this inflation and then you'll see here after 10 years that the supply inflation will hit this 1.5 percent right here so this chart here is showing you the this chart goes over the inflation of the total supply of solana i made a video about the inflation and tokenomics of kadena i also like that project as well i'll link it in my description you can check it out one of the uh one of my followers talked about comparing it to the inflation of solana um and you know it seems like cryptocurrency is very campy everyone's camp team solana team kadena team cardano i don't prescribe to really any of this uh i think there is a lot of unknowns uncertainties in this space i like to diversify my portfolio amongst a bunch of different projects that i see the potential of there being growth and seeing who wins i don't like to be all in on one thing and necessarily trash one thing seems like the narratives switch a lot so that's kind of my approach to this and i am a holder of solana i'm also a holder of kadena i'm also a holder of cardano i'm also a holder of avalanche so when i'm making videos about these things it doesn't necessarily mean this is the only thing i believe in i see people talking about videos of someone bashing kadena and like oh he's a solana holder and all this and you know i i don't know there's bad things about solana there's bad things about cadena there's bad things about avalanche there's good things about avalanche and solana and ethereum and and there are pluses and minuses to all these projects you have to figure out what makes sense with your investing um strategy now this chart here by masari.io to me is very important this is over the five year period this blue part is our circulating supply of soul the gray line here this is our price action now it would make sense that um you know when there was actually if you look at this the price of seoul isn't necessarily yes right now it looks like oh yeah the circulating supply has gone up the price is down that makes sense there's more supply but really this is a demand situation the demand has just decreased a lot there was a ton of demand here for solana there's less demand here yes there is more uh cir the supply has gone up but is not a direct correlation the the circulating supply of soil sold does not directly correlate between the price action or else this gray line would be generally following this downwards like this right if if they were directly correlated you'd have a much smoother uh you'd have a higher nu you'd have a higher original price here and it would kind of come down because there would be that would be saying there's equal demand basically and i kind of have referenced this in comments in my other videos that the the supply the inflation these things is really important but so much that drives these coins is demand and or the price action of these coins is demand and whatever that may be whether it's a narrative whether it's the actual tech whether it's user bases tvl uh all these different things they all come into play when valuating in the market of a uh cryptocurrency so this is the circulating supply of soul and this is the actual amount that is out there being traded now this information here is quite important says the circulating supply acknowledges that tokens may be held by projects foundations which have no intent to sell down their positions but which have not locked up supply in a formal contract thus circulating supply does not include known project treasury holdings which can be significant note that an investor may must carefully consider both liquid and circulating supplies when evaluating an asset the two can be very significantly a risk depending entirely on circulating supply is that the number can change dramatically based on discretionary sale from project treasury so they're saying there is a possibility that there are other coins that are kind of circulating but or that are out there but they're not necessarily being traded at this very time but they could come onto the market and anyways but the number to me that is extremely important when i'm looking at this so this is the five-year chart we can look at the one-year chart here now this does look like there is a direct correlation but basically this is just the bull run ending moving into a bear market and the supply is still going up this is mainly going to be from staking emissions but look here i want to put in the date today is september 7th 2022 so a year ago we had 292 million in circulating supply today we have 349 million we've had a 20 increase of circulating supply so even though the total supply has this annual inflation of eight percent uh we have a circulating supply inflation of 20 that is uh quite a bit of supply but as i or that is quite a bit of inflation but as i showed earlier that the price doesn't necessarily directly correlate to the amount of inflation so when this bear market ends and the bull market comes back can salon a pump and can the demand outweigh the inflation and bring up the price absolutely is there more circulating um sole tokens than there was back during the last bull market so we can look here uh during the last peak peak of the bull market we had 302 million solana tokens so let's actually look at what the inflation has been since that date let's go back to november 8th so if you look here we have had an increase in circulation since the last peak of the price of solana of 16 now if it was directly correlated the price would have only dropped by 16 percent but obviously as you can see that's not the case it's dropped by like 80 to 90 and it's dropped by a crazy amount but that's cryptocurrencies it's unregulated there's a lot of retail money uh there's a lot of big players here that probably sold huge bags and made out with crazy crazy gains so that's just uh part of solana that's just part of cryptocurrency so this is uh interesting this isn't interesting to note as well it says ongoing emissions solana validators voted to enable pico inflation on december 24 2020 the sole supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1 percent guess from 2020 to 2021 there basically wasn't really any inflation to the total supply 0.1 percent and then uh they said the final inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation of 8 decreases 15 annually and down to a 1.5 percent of that total supply but as you can see here the uh annual circulating supply has been inflating by 20 uh which from a currency perspective is not good but this is cryptocurrency these prices move really fast uh this is um yeah so hopefully you enjoyed this quick breakdown of the tokenomics of solana if you did please like the video subscribe to my channel doesn't cost you anything especially a little like to the video or leave your comment leave it leave your thoughts uh tell me if you think i'm wrong tell me if you think i'm right i don't mind either way and uh yeah let's keep going

XuQVNmU7FcY,2.0,0,contrary to what you might think lettuce didn't become expensive just because it was sick of being pushed to the side of your plate and finally decided to demand what it knows it's worth actually it's far more complicated and it's all got to do with something called inflation inflation inflation inflation inflation but um what is that [Music] so inflation can be a bit confusing because when people say inflation they might be talking about one of two things they might be talking about things getting more expensive the lettuce costing 13 now the cost of living just generally going up or they might be talking about money being worth less and less like how your grandma always goes on about how she used to be able to go to the movies with two dollars in her pocket and come home and still have change uh or in more extreme out of control scenarios people being forced to use wheelbarrows full of cash just to buy a loaf of bread the thing is prices going up and the purchasing power of money going down are the same thing and they're both inflation and it's a shame that inflation can be so hard to understand because while it can be useful in small amounts it can also be extremely disruptive and it's everyday folks who tend to cop it the worse a comfortable weekly supermarket shop might double while someone's paycheck stays the same or someone's life savings might go from being a modest home deposit to hardly filling up their car it can push people into poverty and stop them from accessing the things they need like medicine food and housing but in order to understand inflation you'll first need to understand supply and demand you've heard of that right like when lots of people want to buy something but then there's not much of it around so then businesses can get away with charging a lot more for it so consider a situation where people suddenly have a lot more money to spend oh say the government has given out stimulus payments in order to avoid a recession or maybe a small nation discovers there's actually a ton of natural resources under their feet people will suddenly have a lot more cash to splash and they'll want to splash it so suddenly there's more demand and prices can and often do go up sometimes central banks can actually fuel inflation like if they were to lower the cash rate making borrowing money cheaper easier access to money encourages people to spend and invest and well you've created more demand without actually creating more goods and services so prices go up inflation can also happen when there's less supply uh say a war breaks out and it's become geopolitically unpopular to trade with certain large exporters well there'll suddenly be less competition in the market and the politically favorable exporters can charge more for their goods and services because to be honest who else are you going to go to in some cases sudden shocks can also hit supply levels like say you're a farmer and a um climate change fueled flood wipes out half your asparagus crops well then you're still going to need to pay all your stuff you need to pay for the repairs you need to just stay afloat so you might just have to charge double at the next farmer's market per stalk and when things like this happen and the cost of living goes up it's only natural that workers might increase pressure on employers to raise wages either by unionizing or just leaving for a better paying job if there's one available okay people have more money brilliant uh that does possibly mean that businesses could get away with raising prices again though which i guess would increase the cost of living which then could lead to increased pressure for higher wages which then could then lead to higher prices which then oh the dollar doesn't buy as much as it used to does it it's worth noting though that at least in australia for the past few decades uh demands from workers like this really have not been a driving force behind our inflation cycle in fact our wages are barely going up in some cases inflation is also just caused by bad fiscal policy like it might be tempting for a government to try and fix a cash flow problem by just printing more money but if you create more money demand without also creating more goods and services supply well then the balance can get thrown out of whack and money loses value we know this is true because it was actually one of the key causes of a hyper-inflation crisis in zimbabwe in the late noughties where the country was forced to put a 100 trillion dollar note into circulation as inflation just got further and further out of control inflation can also become a problem when there just isn't enough competition between businesses providing the same goods like if you had to switch phone plans but only had a few choices of which telco to go with well then those businesses would be in a much better position to widen their profit margins charge you more than if they had to compete against hundreds of different providers all that being said some inflation is normal and even desirable sometimes like say you had a large debt a mortgage well then mild inflation will make it easier to pay that off because the price you originally paid for the house will stay the same while your wages will notionally increase also the value of your house will go up too so you'll be pretty confident that you'll be able to sell it at a profit in an ideal world where the balance is just right this could create jobs it could mean more income taxes which would mean more money for schools and hospitals and you get the picture but of course often the balance isn't exactly right and the results are less

3I81-P_lwvw,1.0,0,[Music] yesterday i went to the fun fair with my dad it was very fun and i learned something new let me tell you all about it we arrived at the fun fair and my favorite treat just appeared like magic right in front of me i scream [Music] i immediately put on my best convincing voice and said to my dad please dad said okay but just a small one dad went to pay he looked a bit shocked how much that has risen in price he shook his head and paid the money then i saw my favorite game and decided that my convincing voice had to reappear dad rolled his eyes but i knew he couldn't resist a convincing voice how much i want a teddy it was definitely my lucky day it was about to get luckier as i had spotted a balloon cellar please dad looked at his wallet it was almost empty but luckily the balloon seller said why accept all my decretic cards sir of course you do that exclaimed dad was a bit annoyed he didn't have any money left then he said a very strange thing i think your balloon isn't the only thing that's unfloated i was puzzled what do you mean dad dad said well when your balloon gets blown up it is inflated it gets bigger and bigger when the price of items get bigger or increased this is called inflation 2. i asked what sort of things and dad told me everything food toys clothes bikes you name it and the price of things change over time i didn't know that that sounds bad i said to that he said sometimes it is it can mean that things get more expensive and it's harder for some people to buy them it's bad for those who can't buy and for those people who produce things so if you make cars and the price of cars go up not many people will be able to buy your car oh no i exclaimed so you lose your money dad said not really your money loses value and the same amount of money will buy you less if inflation is seven percent your money would be worth seven percent less than it was before for example mom has a set budget to spend on grocery shopping every week but if some items go up in price she will get less items for her budget i wondered why it happened that explained that there were a few reasons why it can be because more people want to buy things which can lead to businesses having a limited amount of sale i thought hmm like when we were trying to buy my bike dad said yes i remember we had to try a few different types of bikes as the companies have risen their prices i remember one of the bikes you liked only had 10 available and 100 people wanted them then the price increased as the business knew they could get more money i asked but does that mean only those people who have more money can afford it dad said yes that's right he also said that the cost of making things can increase because the materials to make them may have also risen in cost he gave me an example my dad loves to tell a story example think of a loaf of bread the price might rise because the flour to make it is more expensive the gas to bake the bread and the fuel to transport the bread to the shops may have risen too ah now i understood but i had to ask the question if the price of items are inflating there's only one thing that hasn't my dad said what's that and i replied my pocket money [Music] you,0.057,0.808,0.135,0.9936,0.13392857142857142,0.16071428571428573,0.044642857142857144,0.07142857142857142,0.19642857142857142,0.07142857142857142,0.13392857142857142,0.1875,0.9529838732542358,0.852359693877551
qF4GepJrT9Y,1.0,0,i actually do without my inflation because inflation is kind of crazy bears you know i'm gonna i'm kind of you know what you can do you know i i want to talk about sort of the the situation we find ourselves in in uh most of the countries that you guys live in now okay here's the thing here's the deal and this is why it's probably good that we do this now when you hear the words inflation or you hear something like interest rates it's very easy for your brain to be like this i think a lot of times these terms are designed and obfuscated in a way to make it hard to focus harder so i'm gonna try and keep it as simple as possible but i also understand that we need to open with a round of let's just all say glizzy hands yep coke let's just get all that fun stuff out of the way all right we good are we good you might do you mind so here's the deal do any of you guys know you probably don't maybe you do the investor charlie munger yes no yes no no no all right he's warren buffett's business partner he's one of the best investors in history pretty old but he has one of the best track records in history he dropped this incredibly dire interview this is him on the right okay really and the stock market is is down a bit this year maybe because of inflation i want to ask you specifically about inflation are we looking at a prolonged decline in the markets because of inflation is inflation on the rise and should we be concerned about it well let me take that in the reverse order inflation is a very serious subject you can argue it's the way democracies die when democracy dies in latin america inflation is a big part of it so it's a huge danger once you've got a populist that learns it can vote itself money listen to that phrase though listen there's a lot of knowledge in this guy i know he's he's like a walking corpse i get it but let's plot some of the things he's saying number one this is how democracies die number two once a population learns they can vote themselves money okay that is key we're gonna say let's finish off this thing though if you look at the roman republic even after they went to a empire with an absolute ruler they inflated the currency steadily for hundreds of years and eventually the whole damn roman empire collapsed and then this guy tries to get into talking lighter news so the interviewer's like wow that's that's dark the collapse of society and so he goes is it something investors need to be worried about specifically when it comes to growth stocks right now those guys let's talk about [ __ ] zoom stock dude it's like what are you talking about hundreds of years of collapse i want to talk about it [ __ ] you know is facebook going up bro well i think the safe assumption for an investor is that over the next 100 years the currency's going to zero wow [Laughter] long paused in a while i love that charlie munger at age 98 is thinking in 100 year timelines this guy [ __ ] he wants to talk about anything else he wants to talk about anything else than charlie murray telling him the world's gonna collapse but uh okay look maybe he's a little too doom and gloom but i wanna i wanna talk about what he said here real quick which is basically that rampant inflation is one of the biggest causes of a societal unrest because any savings that the middle class has accumulated becomes rapidly worthless so let's take a look at this chart right here this chart right here is the amount of money this is about basically the amount of money that the government's printing and then right around the pandemic it spiked at a level never before seen and now it's at all time colossal crazy banana bears high let me back up a little bit so when the when the uh housing crisis 2007 when the great financial crisis happened we were set for a pretty big depression and what stopped it what stopped it was the government just printing a bunch of money basically doing massive bailouts flooding the market with with free money and it worked and unfortunate thing about that working is that we haven't stopped that strategy since and you know this happened slowly over time but since the pandemic it's been absolutely uh insane and so for the first year of it it's like everything's on crack and that's why we got [ __ ] nfts to the moon dogecoin going crazy housing prices skyrocketing but the hangover effects of that is that money starts to become less valuable per dollar that's inflation and so we're starting to get uh the highest recorded inflation ever it's it's happening like crazy uh now now i want to explain real quick so i i want to explain very simply basically when you hear interest rates like the government sets interest rates it's hard to figure out what that means or what's going on interest rates are based so imagine this is the federal reserve it's just a big pile of infinite money and the banks borrow from this and then loan the money out to you basically interest rates are the cost of borrowing money that's it and the government can set it by how much what they charge banks to borrow from them and if you want to juice the economy a little bit if things are rough let's say we have a big housing crisis what you can do is you can lower the interest rate when interest rates are high like if you have money sitting in a bank you'll get you'll get a lot of money if you're just sitting there but when they're low and borrowing money is easy then everyone starts borrowing money to do things like start businesses and hire employees and build factories and and so it juices your economy the problem is when interest rates are low you can't just stash your money in a bank and make money so you can see over the past you know 30 years the government has been continually lowering interest rates to try and juice the economy and then after 2008 they basically dropped them to zero money is essentially free to borrow so right about now is when it's starting to get because we did so much in the past year interest rates were zero we printed a [ __ ] ton of money and the dollar started rewards left less and less and so you're faced with two choices to get inflation back under control they have to raise interest rates and the second it becomes more expensive to borrow companies start collapsing companies that were like basically shoddily run zombie companies yeah our entire economy is basically running on credit and and debt and so uh every single administration knows that it that there's a problem that inflation is starting to get worse and worse and worse but they also know that if they are the ones to pull the plug on the party their whole party loses that it's basically hot potato and so they've been passing this back and forth and just every time they get in power they print a bunch of money to make everybody happy and do things so um the second someone stops printing money they turn off the spigot they stop buying the bad debt they stop printing money they start raising interest rates we're gonna have a recession there's like no way around it there's going to be a return if not a depression the unfortunate thing for biden specifically is that it looks like it's finally happening it looks like the chickens are coming to roost and so he's sort of getting hit with this no-lose situation which is where they're in this real catch-22 where the hot potatoes landed here and they can either raise interest rates collapse the economy destroy people's pensions make a real estate worth way less and so if you tank it you will lose the election guaranteed or you can print a bunch more money to band-aid it and keep inflation hot and kick it down the road but uh the problem is that won't work either because everyone's so mad about inflation that it looks like the democrats are about to get absolutely sweeped in the midterms and so what they're trying to do is talk a big game about how hard they're going to be on inflation while actually not doing very much about it at all because if they actually do anything it's a collapse and on the other side of it if you look at even more zoomed out crazy lens this is the us national debt it's 30 trillion dollars the payments on this debt are now one of the biggest parts of the yearly government budget and one of the best ways to make this debt not a problem is to inflate the currency so much that it's not worth as much so if you inflate the currency enough your debt is worthless the actual what it's actually amount is worthless and so we're running into a situation where um the only way the us can reasonably afford all of the debts that it owes not just on the national debt but on social security etc is to make the amount they owe worth less so there's it's kind of a no-win that's all starting to hit right now do you think this will increase the value of my shiba coin yes so that's the end that's the whole point everything i'm saying today is all to say that shebacoin is the greatest investment thank you for bringing that up yes this whole discussion all goes back to sheba coin which is what i was trying to say can we print more money so we already are and we already are printing an insane amount of money just to keep this [ __ ] ship going but we'd have to print some kind of absurd amount on top of this and that would only further cause the problem zoomers are the clutch or kick generation yeah bro it's all on you guys i love that i love that that's actually a good idea how about us millennials anyone in chat let's just do what the boomers did and kick the can the clock is running out we might barely make it and we can punt it to them and then they can clutch or kick this is actually sounding really good i think if we let jake paul president jake paul fix it

ZrLBM7E7pc4,1.0,0,after over 12 months of debate and multiple changes the inflation reduction act has passed the Senate and House and was signed into law by the president although this act has several focuses regarding health care costs and Taxation the most impactful for Medicare beneficiaries is the prescription drug price reform the IRA legislation aims to make prescription drugs more affordable to the nearly 49 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the country the legislation includes Provisions that will cap costs on party plans allow negotiated prices for expensive meds provide 100 coverage on Part D vaccines and more hi I am Danielle Roberts co-founder of Boomer benefits and author of the best-selling book 10 costly Medicare mistakes you can't afford to make in this video I will dive into everything you need to know about the inflation reduction act and its impact on Medicare beneficiaries be sure to hit that subscribe button to stay up to date with all Medicare changes in the years to come [Music] next year beneficiaries will begin to feel the impact of the approved legislation first up is the cap on monthly insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in 2021 the senior Savings Program was rolled out and prohibited participating drug plans from charging more than a 35 copay for specific insulins listed on their formularies however not all plans were required to comply with this new inflation reduction act all Part D and Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage must cap covered insulin at 35 dollars per month starting in January this includes self-injected insulin and Insulin used with a pump our free Medicare q a group on Facebook gets hundreds of monthly questions about Medicare coverage for vaccines and some vaccines covered by Part D were still costly for many beneficiaries the IRA requires that part D plans must Now cover many of the vaccines that seniors need in full at 100 percent though Medicare Part B covers some vaccinations at 100 such as pneumonia flu covid-19 and hepatitis B some other necessary vaccines fall under Part D coverage One Part D vaccine in particular the shingles vaccine has been a costly and unwelcome surprise to beneficiaries who's sometimes paid for the vaccine in full due to their part D deductible under the new legislation the shingles vaccine must be covered in full bipart D plans without cost sharing of the application of their deductible it's great news that this vaccine will no longer have surprise out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries many people have expressed concern about the pharmaceutical companies raising the cost of certain drugs to make up for losses on other drugs however the legislation addressed this potential loophole as well beginning in 2023 if a drug manufacturer increases its drugs faster than the inflation rate it will have to pay rebates to avoid penalties [Music] in 2024 part D's catastrophic coverage stage is getting a makeover if you are familiar with the structure of Part D plans you know that there are four stages to all Part D plans the fourth and final stage is the catastrophic coverage stage which comes after the coverage Gap or donut hole in the catastrophic stage the beneficiary pays five percent of the cost of their drugs for the remainder of the calendar year after paying 25 cost sharing in the coverage Gap beneficiaries are often relieved to reach the catastrophic stage and pay only five percent however paying even five percent of the cost of medications with no cap can still result in high annual costs for Medicare beneficiaries especially those people on expensive brand name meds in 2024 that five percent cost sharing is gone for good the elimination of this cost sharing means that once you exit the donut hole you no longer have any out-of-pocket costs to worry about with your part D plan the initial coverage stage and the donut hole will remain the same nonetheless this will provide significant relief for Part D enrollees who find it challenging to pay for their necessary medications during the catastrophic coverage stage you are probably wondering if this will Skyrocket your Medicare Part D premiums fortunately in the same cost cutting vein medicare's Part D plans will have a cap on premium increases beginning in 2024. from 2024 to 2029 Medicare Part D premiums cannot increase more than six percent annually this change allows more control over premiums and protects the Medicare beneficiaries from over inflated premiums from the carriers the final change that you can expect in 2024 is an expansion of the low income subsidy program many people know this program as extra help today eligibility for this program starts when income is at 135 percent of the federal poverty level but will change to begin at 150 percent in

ZrLBM7E7pc4,1.0,1,I am particularly happy about this one because we've seen so many people over the years who are very close to qualifying for that extra help but missed it when their income was just slightly over the limit qualifying for the subsidy eliminates the deductible and provides lower co-pays making it more affordable for low-income beneficiaries for their necessary outpatient medications foreign developments in the ira is the two thousand dollar Part D cost cap capping out of pocket prescription costs has been a topic of conversation for years this change will essentially stop the money bleeding when you're out of pocket costs on cover prescription drugs at hit 2000 starting in 2025. the cap will spread throughout the year and essentially eliminate the donut hole stage once and for all the change also allows seniors to spread the burden of the cost throughout the calendar year however please note that there will be no change or impact on the initial coverage stage where you pay reasonable co-pays for your medications foreign beginning in 2026 the federal government will be able to negotiate the cost of certain high priced single-sourced and biological drugs under this new negotiation program the HHS will publish a list of drugs that are eligible for negotiation and the list will include 50 Part D and 50 Part B drugs with the highest total expenditures in the most recent 12-month period negotiated prices must take effect for 10 eligible drugs in 2026 and increased to 20 drugs in 2029 although beneficiaries won't see the negotiated prices until 2026 the government will be taking a significant step in creating more affordable drug prices for seniors which should ultimately benefit all Medicare beneficiaries in the long run though controversial in many ways there is no question that the inflation reduction act will provide much needed relief for many seniors regarding the high cost of prescription drugs Medicare is a behemoth of a program that offers incredible benefits for American seniors however it often comes with confusing intricacies that can be difficult to piece together the Boomer benefits team is committed to helping you better understand your Medicare benefits and be here for you when the inevitable issues arise on the back end we are proud to be one of the only companies of our size with unmatched Part D help for our clients this is just one reason why you will love working with our client service team so be sure to check out the video next to learn 12 other reasons foreign [Music],0.059,0.79,0.151,0.9934,0.07547169811320754,0.18867924528301888,0.03773584905660377,0.18867924528301888,0.1509433962264151,0.07547169811320754,0.03773584905660377,0.24528301886792453,0.9121729928192963,0.8316126735493058
1O3fHAsdjNg,1.0,0,hi my name is ludwig von mises and today i will explain what inflation is in the 16th century when the gold and silver reserves of america were exploited by colonists huge amounts of these precious metals were carried to europe since currencies of the time were minted out of these precious metals there was a general tendency for prices to rise in the same way nowadays when a government increases the amount of money in the economy all money loses purchasing power and consequently prices tend to rise this phenomenon that i've just described is known as inflation unfortunately some people prefer to see inflation not as an increase in the quantity of money but as a rise in prices though that is only one of inflation's effects this semantic revolution is one of the main features of our day it tries to change the meaning of inflation making many people call inflation not the large increase in the money supply but one of its consequences the general trend of prices rising this semantic revolution is far from harmless it plays an important role in fostering popular trends favoring inflationism with this revolution there is no longer a term to designate what the word inflation means it is then difficult to fight a policy that has no name statesmen and writers are no longer able to use a term that the general public understands and relates to the problem of issuing large additional amounts of currency another drawback is that many inflationists say they fight inflation when in fact they promote it you see if inflation is the rise in prices a layman can be convinced that the fault is with greed and opportunism that of businessmen who want ever greater profits but if inflation is the massive expansion of the money supply then the blame lies with governments and their respective central banks for abusing their monopoly over currency it is not uncommon to see politicians and even economists arguing that there is no relationship between monetary expansion and the general increase in prices now under current technological conditions nothing would be easier than making scraps of paper and printing some monetary figures on them in the united states for example where all bills are of the same size printing a one thousand dollar bill would cost the government no more than printing a one dollar bill well let's travel back in time and go back to the 18th century when the first attempts were made to issue bank notes and assign them the status of currency many governments believe that bankers had some magic formula that allowed them to create wealth out of thin air a few years before the french revolution when france was in financial trouble the king sought out one of these ingenious bankers and appointed him to an important position and so monsieur necker famous madame de stahl's father became france's finance minister and everyone expected him to solve the country's financial problems at the time neca decided to send money to the colonists of america to help them in the war of independence against england but he did so without raising taxes seen from today that was certainly the wrong way to try to solve problems what i want to demonstrate is that there is no magic formula if the government needs money it has to obtain it by imposing taxes on its citizens or by borrowing money but most governments think that there is another magical method of obtaining the necessary money which is simply to print it if the government wants to do something beneficial build a hospital for example the government's means for raising the required money is to collect taxes from the citizens and build the hospital with the amount thus acquired in that case there will be no increase in prices because when the government raises money for the construction of the hospital the citizens burdened by this tax are forced to reduce their spending and in that case the amount of money in circulation is not increased of course the government won't buy exactly the same goods that the citizens would buy but the point is that on average there is no rise in prices as a result of the construction of the hospital by the government i chose the example of a hospital precisely because it is so common to hear that inflation is only bad when it is used for bad ends so let's assume that the government always uses the new money it is issued for the best possible purposes it turns out that the issue is not how the money is spent it is how it is obtained by the government for example the government could use the money raised through taxes to hire new employees or to raise the salaries of those already in its service these employees having had an increase in their salaries are then able to buy more when the government collects taxes from citizens and applies this sum to increase the salaries of its staff taxpayers will have less to spend but public servants will have more in this case the trend for prices to rise will not occur but if the government prefers to substantially expand the money supply that is printing a lot of new money or simply typing numbers in the bank accounts of people through easy and cheap credit as it happens nowadays with the advent of technology then some people will start to have more money while everyone else still has as much as before thus those who receive the newly printed money will compete with those who are previously buyers and since there are no more goods than before but there are more units of money in the market and since there are people who can buy more now than yesterday there will be an additional demand for an unchanged quantity of goods therefore prices will tend to rise but it is important to point out that the upward trend in prices will be established step by step since it is not the famous price level when we speak of price level the image that people form in their minds is that of a liquid that rises or falls according to the increase or decrease in its quantity but which like a liquid in a reservoir always rises evenly but with prices there is no such thing as evenly as an effect that became known as the cantion effect explains prices do not change to the same extent much less immediately after monetary expansion there are always prices that change faster fall or rise faster than others and there's a reason for that people do not all precisely buy the same goods in the same quantities on the same day the extra money that the government printed and spent is not used to purchase all goods and services evenly it is used in the purchase of certain commodities the prices of which will rise while others will still remain at the prices held before the new money was introduced into the market so when inflation starts different groups of the population get affected in different ways the groups who first receive the new money gain an advantage over those that receive the new money last when prices have gone higher let's illustrate this with an example suppose the government issues substantial amounts of money to pay for a war and with that new currency it buys ammunition the first to receive the additional money then are the ammunition industries and those who work for them they end up earning higher profits and earning higher wages because their businesses flourish why is that because they were the first to receive the additional money and now having more money in their hands they can buy more and they buy from other people who manufacture and sell the goods they demand these other people constitute a second group benefiting from the new money now received and this second group too considers inflation to be very beneficial for their business why not isn't it splendid to sell more and the owner of a restaurant located in the surroundings of a munitions factory for example says it's really wonderful ammunition workers have more money they are coming to my establishment like never before they're all supporting my restaurant this makes me very happy the situation is as follows those groups to whom money arrives first have their purchasing power increased and can continue to buy many goods and services at prices that match with the previous state of the market at the situation prevailing on the eve of inflation but there are other groups of the population for whom this money arrives much later these people find themselves in an unfavorable situation before they have access to the additional money prices have already risen and they are obliged to pay higher prices than previously for some commodities they wish to acquire or practically all of them while their earnings remain the same or do not increase proportionally to the prices at each moment therefore those groups directly affected by inflation are all different for some of them inflation is not that bad and they even defend its extension here comes the resulting issue governments tend to prefer inflation to increasing taxes increasing taxes is an extremely unpopular measure we have had revolutions that started due to an increase in taxes on the other hand inflation more hidden is not that unpopular yet of course most politicians are not going to say i will adopt inflation as a method the technical procedures used to produce inflation are very complex which makes the common citizen with too little time to delve into the topic not realize that inflation has started it is not easy to simplify such complex topics and i certainly wouldn't have written huge works on this topic if they're as simple as they seem to be but fundamentals are precisely these if the amount of money in circulation increases while other things remain the same the value of money falls well let's go back in time again and look at one of the biggest inflations of all history the one that took place in the german reich after the first world war and that reached its peak in the post-war period the government as expected did not announce anything it simply made the central bank print more money ultimately great inflation ends with the collapse of the currency giving rise to a catastrophe a situation like that which occurred in germany in 1923. on the 1st of august 1914 one dollar was at par with four marks and 20 fennigs nine years and three months later in november 1923 one dollar was quoted at a staggering 4.2 trillion marks in other words the mark was no longer worth anything some say at the end of the day we're all dead i'm sorry to confirm that they are correct but the question is how long will the present moment last in the 18th century there was a famous lady madame de pompadour to whom the following saying is assigned aprenu le deluge after us the flood madame de pompadour died shortly afterwards but her successor madame dubari survived a little longer only enough to be beheaded for many the long run soon becomes the present and the more inflation advances the more the long run is faced as unanticipated let us return to the case of germany which the whole world witnessed many books have described the events of that period and i have seen with my own eyes a similar situation in my country austria for many years the german people believed that their inflation was nothing more than a temporary situation which would soon end as the inflation continued however the population thought it wiser to buy everything that was for sale anything instead of keeping the money in their pockets furthermore people reasoned that it was not convenient to lend money to be a creditor on the other hand it was excellent business to borrow money to be in debt debt would buy you anything in those times thus inflation continued to feed on itself inflation continued in germany until the autumn of 1923 at that time the country's factories paid their workers every morning one day in advance and the worker who was accompanied by his wife to the factory immediately gave her his earnings of the day all the millions he had just received she would then promptly go to a store to buy anything she saw what most people knew at the time the mark lost overnight an incredible 50 percent of its purchasing power money melted in people's pockets like a chocolate bar over a hot oven this final phase of german inflation did not last long after a few days the whole nightmare was over the mark had lost all value and a new currency had to be established we must remember that in the end we may all be dead in fact there is no doubt that we will all be dead but we should take care of our earthly affairs during this brief interval in which we are allowed to live the best we can and one of the measures necessary for this purpose is to abandon inflationary policies

jAvZSGUCWjg,1.0,0,welcome back to Kano Academy today we'll be covering the subject of Economics by discussing inflation in today's video we'll focus on what is inflation as well as the different types of inflation and the causes of inflation including some of the consequences of inflation as well as several measures to combat inflation please watch until the end of the video because we'll also provide you with some valuable tips to help you Ace your assignments tests and exams so let's get started as an introduction let us Define what we mean by the term inflation inflation refers to a sustained and significant increase in the general price level over a period of time and at the same time a decline in the buying power of money there are different types of inflation in this next section we will look at the following four type types which are consumer inflation producer inflation and all-inclusive inflation and hyperinflation let's briefly discuss each of these types starting with consumer inflation this is also known as CPI which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services that are typically purchased by consumers this includes things like food clothing transportation and housing producer inflation is another type of inflation this is also known as PPI this measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services that are typically purchased by businesses this includes things like raw materials intermediate goods and energy another type of inflation is known as an all-inclusive inflation all inclusive inflation measures the rate of change in prices of all goods and services for both consumer and produce sir this is a broader measure of inflation than CPI or PPI the last type of inflation we will look at is hyperinflation hyperinflation is a very high rate of inflation typically defined as an annual inflation rate of 50 or more hyperinflation can be very disruptive to an economy as it can lead to a loss of faith in the currency and a collapse of the economy inflation can be caused by various factors in this next section we will discuss these two factors starting with demand pull inflation this occurs when there is excessive demand for goods and services relative to the available Supply when demand outpaces Supply prices tend to rise another cause of inflation can be cost push inflation this happens when the cost of production increases leading to higher prices factors such as rising wages increased raw material costs or higher taxes can contribute to cost push inflation there are numerous consequences of inflation in this next section we will discuss how inflation affects the following starting with debtors and creditors debtors benefit because they receive money with a high purchasing power and repay their debt with money with low purchasing power creditors on the other hand may suffer due to inflation inflation also impacts on wage and salary earners people with a fixed income will be able to purchase less as prices are rising another consequence of inflation can be felt by investors and Savers assets with a fixed nominal value have a fixed return and lower purchasing power as prices increase furthermore real value of savings also decreases inflation also affects taxpayers in South Africa income is taxed on a progressive system therefore inflation causes what is termed as a bracket creep this is when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets or reduces the value of credits deductions and exemptions bracket creep essentially results in an increase in income taxes without an increase in real income lastly another consequence of inflation is the disruption of industrial peace which is often caused by wage bargaining and usually accompanied by strikes and mass action there are a number of measures that the government and policy makers can use to fight inflation when it gets too high in this next section we highlight three types of policy measures to be used to combat inflation let's start with fiscal measures these are specific measures taken by the government and particularly the Minister of Finance regarding Taxation and expenditure these measures can include the following an increase in direct taxation such as personal income tax which will help to decrease demand an increase in indirect taxation such as vat which will lead to a decrease in spending because Goods become more expensive a loan Levy which will ultimately reduce disposable income of consumers the state could consider cutting back on expenditure by canceling government projects like roads hospitals and schools the state could also impose surcharges on imported goods this will increase the price of these imported goods resulting in many people being unable to afford to buy these Goods the country's Reserve Bank and the government can also apply certain monetary measures to curb inflation including the following the Reserve Bank can adjust the quantity of money to meet the needs of the economy through EG open market policy thus maintaining a fine balance The Reserve Bank can also curb inflation caused by excess Demand by reducing the money supply The Reserve Bank can also apply moral pressure on financial institutions to be more careful when granting credit the repo rate is another tool used by central banks to manage monetary policy and influence economic conditions while the repo rate is primarily used to control borrowing costs and stimulate or restrict economic activity it can indirectly impact savings as well when the Central Bank increases the repo rate it often leads to higher interest rates offered by commercial banks on savings accounts and fixed deposits this can make saving more attractive as individuals can earn higher Returns on their savings the prospect of earning a better interest rate can therefore encourage people to save more additional measures that can be taken to combat inflation include the following increase productivity this is a long-term measure generated through improved Education and Training which allows more people to be employed and ensures they are more productive price control by fixing the price of certain essential Goods the government assures they remain affordable wage policy the government can also take a decision to break the inflationary spiral of increased wages and prices by keeping the increase in wages below or at the level of inflation stricter conditions for Consumer Credit the government can also make it harder for consumers to get credit in order to restrict their spending encourage personal savings as indicated previously The Government Can Implement measures to encourage savings for example by cutting taxes on savings the imbalance between demand and Supply is corrected by increased savings as people save more and spend less relaxed import controls the government and policy makers may also consider relaxing import control measures through tariff reductions removal of import quotas easing import restrictions and entering into free trade agreements another measure to combat inflation is by using floating exchange rate this is when prices are automatically adjusted to International conditions indexation this is a policy of linking prices of items such as wages pensions and mortgage bond interest rates to price indices in order to eliminate the effects of inflation before we continue as promised here are five quick study tips starting with number five start studying early don't wait until the night before the exam to start studying give yourself plenty of time to learn the material so that you can absorb it properly number four create data study schedule and stick to it break down the material into manageable chunks and schedule time to study each day this will help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed number three find a study method that works for you some people prefer to read their textbooks While others prefer to take notes or watch videos experiment with different methods until you find one that helps you learn the material effectively number two take breaks studying for long periods of time can be counterproductive get up and move around every 20 to 30 minutes to avoid getting burned out and very important number one get a good night's sleep before the exam this will help you be alert and focused on exam day now back to today's topic just to recap on what we covered in this video inflation refers to a sustained and significant increase in the general price level over a period of time this means that on average the prices of goods and services are rising while the purchasing power of a unit of currency is decreasing there are also different types of inflation in this video we looked at the following four types which are consumer inflation producer inflation all inclusive inflation as well as hyperinflation we also learned the various factors that cause inflation including demand pull inflation and cost push inflation we also covered a number of consequences as a result of inflation and also learned that there are a number of measures that can be taken to combat inflation including fiscal and monetary policy measures that the government and policy makers can use to fight inflation we also listed other measures to be considered to understand more on this topic please take time to re-watch this video we hope we were able to provide more clarity on the topic of inflation if we have please let us know by leaving us a comment below this video we would love to know what you have learned on this topic you can also leave us a thumbs up to show your appreciation also make sure you like this video and take time to share and subscribe for more until we meet

dgmDcK5wssU,2.0,0,[Music] consumer prices are up interest rates are rising after about a generation global inflation is surging again why have millions of people around the world become exposed to high inflation and what can we do to bring it back under control henry i'm going to start with you what is inflation inflation is a rise in prices uh it's a rise in average prices measured by a basket of goods and services typically it's when everything gets expensive and when you think about that it's important to realize it's not when just one thing gets more expensive that's what we call a change in relative prices it's a change in overall prices why do economists get so exercised about it what happens if we just let inflation kind of do its thing why do we care so if inflation starts creeping up and i think that that's going to last then i might start pushing up you know the wage increase that i would like or the um prices that i would like to set and so what you have what you end up having is a situation where prices start creeping up higher and higher and higher and we know from places where inflation is really high that that has a cost my own view is that it's really more like an on off switch either inflation is low enough that people don't really have to worry about it too much or it's high enough that they pay a lot of attention because they're feeling it every time they buy anything and they have to budget more carefully and all the things that are going on right now and then it really shoots up the scales in terms of its political importance what are the levers that policymakers have to make inflation go up or down well there's been a consensus for about three decades or so that the primary responsibility for controlling inflation is the responsibility of the central bank and that the way in which you control inflation is by raising interest rates when inflation's too high which reduces the amount of spending in the economy reduces the amount of money chasing a limited pool of goods and services which is ultimately what causes people to put their prices up at the moment with inflation too high the real question is how high are central banks going to raise interest rates in order to fight it the next section we're going to is what we're going to do about inflation now um obviously at the moment central banks are raising rates pretty rapidly is this going to cause inflation to come down fairly quickly as the central banks hope i mean that's the question of the day really is how effective central banks are going to be in bringing down inflation the pace of the monetary tightening is pretty steep it's the steepest in america since the early 1980s um so after a period of hesitation it looks like they're taking the problem seriously um the real question now is how much pain that's going to cause i think there's a sort of dirty little secret of monetary economics and that's that the actual mechanisms by which higher interest rates flow through the economy aren't that well understood it wouldn't surprise me if they still have to go significantly higher but i have complete faith in the ability of higher interest rates to bring down inflation ultimately because if you raise rates high enough it will it will as ratchet said cause a cause a recession eventually and that's very effective at bringing inflation down if you're a policy maker now like what else are you or should you be thinking about doing to get inflation expectations down to the extent that inflation is about the balance between demand and supply in the economy you know other policies that reduce aggregate demand would bring inflation down as well and their you know tighter fiscal policy raising taxes reducing spending would bring down prices as well what we're being reminded of right now is just how unpopular inflation is how much people dislike um you know prices pump going up um the feeling that when they go to supermarkets they can afford less and less you know and and that has political consequences and can drive politicians and governments to try to do things to rein in price rises the proof is in the pudding central banks have to deliver the low inflation and then people will believe that inflation is going to be low thanks for watching to read the economist coverage of inflation click on the link and don't forget to subscribe,0.043,0.874,0.082,0.9814,0.072,0.176,0.048,0.288,0.096,0.072,0.04,0.208,0.8989045112953852,0.8193280000000001

OwH9dTJTkZk,1.0,0,welcome back to our series where we're explaining all the economic data releases that you see in the monthly cycle and how they relate to each other in order to better help you deal with them in the markets this week we're going to be taking a look at another inflation measure but this time it's the producer price index also known as ppi whereas last week we were talking about the consumer price index cpi and if you're not sure what cpi is or inflation in general then click up here and watch that one first and then come back to this one but if you are sticking around then let's get started ppi is the producer price index and it's an alternative measure of inflation it doesn't really catch the mainstream headlines in the same way that cpi and pce do but it's still an important release in its own right so ppi measures inflation by comparing the average selling prices received by domestic producers for their output this is one of the reasons it doesn't really carry the same weight as the cpi release because cpi measures what consumers are actually paying and therefore includes things like sales tax and markups that won't show in ppi so as an overall gauge of inflation in an economy those other releases are probably going to give a better picture instead ppi is measuring the changes in production costs and it covers a number of industries from agriculture to manufacturing but what does all of this actually mean well since it's measuring price changes earlier in the production stage it's often used as a gauge for what we may see in the bigger inflation data releases down the line because if producers face higher costs eventually these are likely to be passed on to retailers and then to consumers which would obviously show as increases in the cpi and pce releases ppi release is split into three categories we have the commodity index the stage of processing index and then the core reading and each of these represents different parts of the production chain so let's say for example the cost of raw materials are increasing then this would first show up in the commodity index this is showing the price that producers are paying for goods and if the cost of raw materials is on the rise then the stage of processing index which measures costs in the middle stages of production is also likely to increase and then at the end we have the core headline figure which measures price changes of finished goods at the end of the production chain so these finished goods then head off to retailers and ultimately consumers where the higher prices earlier in a production chain could eventually lead to higher costs of goods so let's go on to see how cpi relates to other data releases but first if you're finding this helpful i would love it if you would just tap that like button and help us keep doing what we're doing on this channel i'd really appreciate it let's move on so we've already seen how price changes in ppi can lead to changes in cpi and pce however it can also be used to filter out the causes of inflation in those releases for example if cpi and pce are on the rise but ppi is relatively stable then inflation is probably being caused by something other than input costs for retailers if they both increase at a similar rate then retailers are likely just maintaining their margins as input costs rise but if ppi is increasing and cpi and pce aren't then someone somewhere is soaking up the cost in the chain it could be producers or retailers and this may be a sign that prices are already high and they're expecting that consumers won't pay any further price increases so this would likely impact on margins which could result in lower earnings and lower profits for producers and retailers in this case they may try to find buyers in export markets but they're likely going to see slower growth in earnings until consumer purchasing power recovers now if you want to know about the rest of the economic data releases then check out this playlist here to go through the series so far and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss when the next ones come out we're going to be covering all of them and linking them all together for you my name is nicholas this is market movers thank you so much for watching take care,0.01,0.906,0.084,0.9955,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.01818181818181818,0.2,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.05454545454545454,0.2727272727272727,0.8166069704215356,0.7914049586776859
L92eadRu6zE,1.0,0,hi guys just a quick little announcement before today's video I know that a lot of you prefer to listen to these videos so I want to let you know that the entire AE library is up on Spotify so you can listen to it on the go without ads either way I hope you enjoy the video if 2022 was defined by one economic problem it would be inflation inflation in most advanced economies around the world right now is running very high with some countries once famed for their monetary stability seeing double-digit annual price increases these are also just the headline figures which don't account for a lot of the expenses endured by real households even though that's technically what they're supposed to do interest rates are perhaps the obvious example of this because they are somewhat of a double-edged sword they are the primary tool that central banks can use to rein in inflation but they also cause interest payments for regular households to increase at the same time that they are struggling to pay for everything else in the world that's suddenly 50 more expensive than it was two years ago these are just advanced economies as well select developing economies are running double-digit monthly inflation but for the most part these isolated examples are having these problems because of things like bad governance and a refusal to raise interest rates like everybody else is trying to do right now I'm not going to name names but I will will say that it's ironic that Thanksgiving is coming up soon raising interest rates in countries that still have consistently High inflation is the right move even if it is bitter medicine but as with most things a prevention is better than a cure so perhaps the most productive way to understand what is truly causing persistent inflation in our own economies is to look at other economies that aren't having that problem at all even if the lessons of places like Switzerland select European countries and yes even China are too late to implement in our own economies now they can potentially teach us a lot about why inflation actually happens and how to avoid it in the future so why are select countries from around the world not having the same problems with inflation that every other country is could we just do what they are doing to fix this inflation issue ourselves and at what cost did these economies gain their immunity from inflation once we have done all of that we can put the economy of Switzerland on the economics explained National leaderboard one of the most important things to understand about inflation is that inflation is goods and services becoming more expensive not money becoming less valuable that might just sound like a different side of the same coin but it's really important the reason this is important to understand is because different areas can have different rates of inflation at different times even if they are all using exactly the same currency this is normally not recognized because inflation is measured on a national level and Nations almost always use a single currency but inflation in California for example can be significantly higher or lower than inflation in Michigan at any given time when you think of inflation as the rising costs of goods and services this makes much more sense because different issues impacting market prices can impact different regions yes one way inflation can be increased is by governments and central banks injecting lots of cash into the economy to increase total demand more demand naturally leads to higher prices but there are other ways than inflation can come about that are more specific to individual regions Michigan for example might have a particularly cold winter which increases demand and therefore the price of energy to keep homes warm while California with its more temperate climate won't have the same problems and therefore won't experience that Rising price level another real example might be the tech boom that took place in California during the 2000s and 2010s lots of high-paying local jobs created a region of household demand much higher than the national average which is why most things in Californian cities cost more than the same things in our regional town if you have been looking at reported inflation figures in your own country you would have seen figures of around six to ten percent and I'm sure a lot of you would have thought that that couldn't possibly be true because your own cost of living had increased so much faster than that well there's a good chance you are probably right because inflation is measured using the increasing price of the Consumer Price Index which is a diverse selection of goods and services indicative of the spending of a regular Urban household so in a Twisted way inflation has been even worse than the news has been reporting not only due to inconsistent indexes but because inflation is a black hole decimating everything in its surroundings like stocks and bonds long touted as the perfect complementary Investments they've lost 36 trillion dollars this year that's more than the GDP of the entire United States and that's why this video was sponsored by Masterworks now the average 60 40 portfolio of these stocks and bonds that Millions rely on is having the worst year in a hundred years down 34 percent but Morgan Stanley one of the biggest banks in the world may have a way to rescue your sinking portfolio they say including alternative assets would potentially lower volatility and increase returns but which Alternatives not just gold or real estate but fine art CNBC says the global Rich see fine art as a hedge against inflation and perhaps a safer store of value than increasingly volatile stocks and crypto no wonder City reports the total median expenditure on Art could hit double its level last year that's in 2022 where we saw the worst start to the stock market in 50 years the difference is astounding and really exciting for investors looking to recoup some historic losses so how do you invest in art yourself without spending Millions with Masterworks Masterworks lets you invest in multi-million dollar works of art from legendary artists like also Basquiat and Banksy these are not nfts this contemporary art has outpaced the S P 500 by 131 for the past 26 years even during the Roaring bull market of the last decade that's how Masterworks has managed to deliver returns even in a year fraught with disaster in fact they saw the painting just over a week ago for a 17.5 percent net return that brings their three most recent sales to over 17 21 and 33 net returns as a result of this standout performance Masterworks has had to acquire and release more art onto their platform to meet demand and there is a waitlist to join their 550 000 plus other members but you can skip it just by clicking the link in the description if you live away from a big city or have abnormal spinning habits then chances are your cost of living would have increased faster than the headline figures because Niche products and services and markets in smaller economic centers normally suffer more during periods of high inflation now somewhere where we can see this actually represented in the figures is Europe because Europe is home to a lot of countries with the majority of them using the same currency the Euro France has had a reported year on year inflation rate of 6.2 percent which is still much higher than the European Central bank's Target inflation rate of 2 percent but it's much lower than a country like Latvia with an inflation rate of 22 percent despite using the same currency so how is one country using the same currency experiencing inflation almost four times higher than another country well there are the obvious issues Latvia is much closer geographically to Russia and Ukraine and is therefore more heavily impacted by disruptions in the region Latvia is closer to the now shut off industrial centers of Russia than is to most of the European Union so it naturally did more business with Russia and also lost a lot more due to trade sanctions but there is more to it inflation in France is measured differently to inflation in Latvia Latvia is a much poorer country than France and poorer country households naturally spend a larger portion of their income on the Bare Essentials like food and energy whereas in rich countries these items normally only take up a small share of household income this means the Consumer Price Index in Latvia will be more heavily weighted with things like food and energy at the moment food and energy are the markets most impacted by global events and because these markets are so heavily represented in Latvia's CPI its inflation rate is higher if France's inflation was measured using Latvia's Consumer Price Index its inflation rate would be a fair bit higher and if Latvia's inflation rate was measured using France's Consumer Price Index it would be a fair bit lower that doesn't mean that these calculations are flawed quite the opposite actually we measure inflation to get an idea of what is going on in the economy and the people within a nation are what drives that economy so it's important that the Consumer Price Index is indicative of the spending habits of people within that economy if White flags and poodle haircuts are not what most households in Latvia are spending their money on their economy shouldn't be measured on those goods and services it is still important to remember this detail though because it means that direct comparisons of inflation rates can often be misleading especially between countries with very different socioeconomic conditions but beyond that disclaimer no matter what metrics you use France is still running a lower rate of inflation than other EU countries and you might have noticed on this list a European country that is running an inflation rate half that of even France so what is Switzerland doing right Switzerland is a very wealthy country its citizens are amongst the wealthiest in the world with only Australia and a select group of micro Nations giving it any real competition wealthier citizens are going to make for an economy that is less susceptible to inflation because richer people are going to spend a lower portion of their income on Essentials and a higher portion on luxuries that they can choose to go without if they become too expensive restaurant meals are a great example of this wealthier households are going to spend more on restaurant meals than households that are struggling to make ends meet if inflation is very high those wealthy households might just choose to eat at home which will reduce demand for restaurant meals and force restaurants to reduce their prices by running sales to attract fickle customers back to their tables poorer households can't choose to stop spending money at restaurants because they likely weren't doing it to begin with and they also can't stop consuming Bare Essentials like food because well they're Bare Essentials without food you starve so people are willing to spend whatever they must to feed their families but there is still more to this Swiss Story one thing that a lot of other outlets have been focusing on is the relative stability of the Swiss franc when compared to the US dollar it is one of the few countries in the world that has not lost significant value this year the main reason for this relative strength is that the Swiss franc is heavily backed by large reserves of gold Financial assets real estate and bonds from other governments this means that the Swiss Central Bank can ensure the currency stability in the Foreign Exchange Market because if the price of the currency gets too low they can sell their assets in exchange for Swiss Francs and if the value of the currency gets too high they can trade their Franks for more assets people who have watched my videos on countries like China might remember that this sounds like a currency Peg but it is a little bit different in Switzerland's case because they do not Target a specific price they let the marketer determine the price for the most part but they will intervene if they feel it is necessary now this explanation is not wrong it just omits some very important details because remember inflation is not the same same thing as money becoming less valuable the real reason that Switzerland is writing out the global inflation storm so well is ironically because it does a lot of trade Switzerland is a country heavily dependent on trade both imports and exports the total value of all trade relative to the size of an economy is something that economists call Trade intensity Switzerland Imports about 300 billion US dollars worth of goods and services every year and exports about the same amount that works out to a per capita Import and Export value of around 35 000 per citizen for reference the USA exports around four thousand dollars per capita and imports just under seven thousand dollars per capita this does get a bit confusing because International Trade has normally been seen as one of the big contributing factors causing inflation with Global Supply chains and trade tensions having all manner of problems around the world but as with most things in economics it's important not to over generalize most of Switzerland's Imports come from its neighboring countries in the EU and the UK these trade routes are extremely direct with trains and trucks that won't suffer from closed ports or delays at distribution centers Switzerland is also able to leverage their strong currency to buy these Imports at a 10 discount from what they were 12 months ago in a country like the USA where total Imports account for a relatively low share of total output this wouldn't make a huge difference but remember the average Swiss citizen is importing 35 000 worth of stuff every year and if they were getting that stuff from Euro countries using their francs they would be three thousand five hundred dollars better off for no other reason than their strong currency which offsets a large part of any inflation they were subject to on the flip side most of Switzerland's exports are very high-end goods and services with significant value add that aren't going to be as heavily impacted by global unrestors large-scale low margin Commodities there are also smaller factors like the country's use of hydroelectric power for for a majority of its energy making it less susceptible to the oil and gas price volatilities a lot of other countries in Europe are suffering from so is there anything to learn from Switzerland unfortunately not really no apart from maybe seeing the benefits of investing in highly evaluating Industries and renewable resources Switzerland has actually historically been struggling with deflation which is slowing growth in an otherwise very prosperous country it's important to remember that economic slowdowns normally bring with them low inflation and a lot of economies that aren't having inflation problems right now are only in that position because they have larger economic issues that are crippling consumer demand you can go and watch our video on Japan or why China is not going to collapse to find out why deflation can be just as bad if not worse than inflation these problems aren't as present in Switzerland but most economies will still have to forego significant growth to get themselves into a position as stable as Switzerland's which is a fine trade to make when all of their citizens have a high standard of living but a high had a trade-off to make when sustained growth could be the key to lifting millions of people out of poverty beyond that I'm sure most economies would love to be Switzerland in the same way that I would love to be a multi-millionaire it's not feasible to point to one of the wealthiest countries in the world and ask other economies why they can't just do what Switzerland is doing but what we can learn from Switzerland is where it sits on the economics explained National leaderboard starting as always with size Switzerland has a GDP of 813 billion US Dollars which makes it the 20th largest economy in the world and it gets a 7 out of 10. that might not sound that impressive but GDP per capita is amongst the highest in the world at 93 457 dollars per citizen for reference the USA which is itself a remarkably productive country has a GDP per capita of just 69 288 this impressive figure is due to the highly technical industries that Swiss residents work in I have used the process of turning raw steel into wristwatches countless times on this channel as the perfect example of adding value in an economy and nobody does this better than the Swiss he gets a 10 out of 10. stability and confidence is also very high though it's days of banking for the world's secretive Elite are behind it it is still the go-to destination for more above-board financial operations because of its world-renowned neutrality and stability it gets a 10 out of 10. growth has been strong relative to its European neighbors but they haven't exactly been sitting the bar extremely high the perhaps overly careful governing system of the country favors slow stable growth and that's what they've been having it gets a 7 out of 10. finally industry while it's not massive the industries that they do have are World leading if you want the best Bankers you get a Swiss Banker if you want the best chocolate you get Swiss chocolate and if you want the best watches you get Swiss watches Swiss industry gets an 8 out of 10. altogether that gives the economy of Switzerland an average score of 8.4 out of 10 putting it into third place on the leaderboard thanks for watching mate

Y2i7Ng6cEKY,3.0,0,several government bonds from around the world are now offering negative yields as in if you buy the bond you are going to get back less money than you put into it so who in their right mind would buy an investment where you are guaranteed to lose money the answer is mostly large institutions that need somewhere safe to keep their cash you see regular bank accounts just don't cut it when you have tens of billions of dollars because they are normally only insured up to a certain level in the us for example that level is 250 000 government bonds are for obvious reasons fully backed by the government so if for example apple was afraid of inflation of the us dollar and wanted to keep its vast piles of cash as euros let's say it would have to pick a safe country like germany that uses the euro and take whatever they were offering for their bonds this might still work out to be a profitable decision though if the euro loses value to inflation at just 0.4 percent per year slower than the us dollar,0.043,0.864,0.093,0.8024,0.1111111111111111,0.08888888888888889,0.044444444444444446,0.2,0.13333333333333333,0.044444444444444446,0.06666666666666667,0.3111111111111111,0.8994577217194141,0.8167901234567901
MpsTYYgMmKY,1.0,0,you've probably noticed that when you see inflation data in the economic calendar or when you read the financial news they'll often refer to headline inflation and core inflation so what's the difference well as you know the way that inflation measures are usually explained is by referring to a basket of goods and services essentially you're measuring the price change over time of that basket of items and if the price of that basket of goods and services goes up that's inflation so headline inflation looks at a price of everything in that basket so it's the whole basket of goods and services whereas core inflation looks at the price of the basket after removing items that have more volatile prices like energy and food so it's the whole basket excluding certain items now policy makers like those guys at the central bank will usually focus more on Headline inflation James Butler's a policy maker at the Federal Reserve has previously mentioned that they prefer headline inflation because it includes everything a household is purchasing people don't generally have the options to just exclude food or fuel from their expenses although it would be pretty good if you could but that doesn't mean that core inflation is useless in fact it can give us a much better picture of what's going on overall in the economy so let's look at two broad scenarios so I can help you to understand this in scenario one headline inflation is significantly higher than core inflation if this is the case it could signal that prices are being driven by the volatile items like energy and food now since their prices can fluctuate up and down a lot more often inflation in those areas tends to fall more into the temporary category or that Infamous term transitory and this would be known as cost push inflation where higher prices are being caused by something on the supply side now monetary policy isn't really well suited for fixing Supply problems and so from a central bank's point of view there's probably not much point in slowing the economy down too much if they can't actually address the core issue it may also be the case that they forecast prices will fall in the medium to long term so they're willing to accept some above Target inflation in the short term while they wait for that to happen now this doesn't mean that they won't take action but it just might come in the form of a slower pace of interest rate Rises or something like that however if inflation runs too high for too long the Central Bank will probably begin to take much bigger action and that brings us on to scenario two so in this scenario headline inflation and core inflation are both running relatively high this could signal that inflation is more broad throughout the whole economy and there's too much demand for goods and services relative to the the lower Supply it could even come as a result of inflation from other areas spilling over into the broader economy things like Energy prices so energy inflation can affect everything in the economy it's not just about the energy that you buy as a consumer being more expensive but also situations like retailers passing on their cost increases can consumers in the form of higher prices so this can sort of broadly push up the prices of things throughout the whole economy and therefore as a result workers are going to start demanding higher wages and again that's going to push up demand even more and it could lead to a situation where we have a wage price spiral which could cause inflation to continue to rise so you can see how the different aspects are interconnected throughout the economy and how inflation in one area can cause a knock-on effect so in this sort of situation inflation would be considered to be much more persistent and the central bank would likely be tightening their policy to try and get it back under control so that would typically mean raising interest rates and slowing economic growth now we've only looked at two broad scenarios there and there could be many other factors to consider like the labor market and so on but you can already begin to see how headline and core inflation can be used together to build a better picture of what's happening in the economy and to anticipate the sort of actions a central bank may take in the future and if you want to understand more about inflation including how it affects the markets for Traders and investors there are other videos on screen now hit the Thumbs Up Button if you found this helpful thanks for watching,0.02,0.885,0.095,0.9959,0.041237113402061855,0.14432989690721648,0.010309278350515464,0.30927835051546393,0.09278350515463918,0.061855670103092786,0.020618556701030927,0.31958762886597936,0.7974662311882765,0.766712721862047

iJUQefeMlJI,1.0,0,we have so much on our plate to talk about the one thing we haven't talked about yet is the inflation numbers and it is remarkable joe biden has just come out and said we have zero inflation this month wow we did it we did it we solved it we did we did so that we can start printing more money we have zero inflation the news that came out today relative to the economy actually i just want to say a number zero euro today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of july that's weird yeah zero percent because that's not how that means well the price of some things go up went up last month the price of other things went down by the same amount so we have zero results zero inflation last month now zero that's incredible there and it's interesting because every single publication is is reporting the number as 8.5 right now but that's very close to zero very close to zero now i want to be clear to show you how disingenuous this person is this is how he's come to this conclusion okay okay because people are saying oh he's lying and he's not quite lying this is what he's doing okay now every single time we talk about inflation we talk about it as an annual number right right that is how we talk about it year to year yes everybody talks about it the same way 8.5 is the headline annual number that's the number that everyone has been talking about which everyone focuses on so what he's done is take that number and ignore it completely then he's converted what he's looking at from the headline number to the core number now there's two different measures of inflation basically the core number takes out food and takes out energy to summarize it so that number was uh 5.9 i believe it was this uh this which is zero which is which is i don't know if it's closer than 8.5 but one of the two they're both very close to zero right now you gotta scale from one to a billion five some might as well call it zero right we're just sure so he's ignored the main number he's presented only the core number which has been lowered the entire time and then he's instead of taking the annual measure he's done only the month-to-month measure now no one the the month-to-month measure is not the number that anyone talks about and to be clear it was only supposed to be 0.2 so what he's saying is now that's almost zero anyway that's what everyone was expecting it to be was 0.2 percent instead it was 0.0 percent and he's out there bragging and saying oh well this shows there's no inflation month to month so he's ignored the main measure and he's basically taking the secondary core measure and divided it by 12 even though that's not exactly how they come up with the number and he's saying that there's been no inflation now this is entirely disingenuous and what i've said before on this program on stew does america as well we are very close to one of the most annoying things you're ever going to experience which is this main number that everyone's talking about 9.1 percent is going to start getting lower and when that happens the administration is going to brag about it however this is important this is important what most people will say when you when you say to him hey inflation last month was 9.1 percent and this time it's 8.5 most people will say first of all it's going down that's going to be their initial reaction okay it's going down and because most people will say that the administration is going to brag about it going down secondarily you will think it's month to month well yeah that's the annual measure but it's two separate months measuring most people will say okay so if something was a hundred dollars a year ago uh it was 109.00 last month and now it's 108.50 right it's coming down a little bit it's important to know that's not how this number works the number works based on a year to year measure so they're comparing july to the previous july the reason why i'm saying these numbers are going to come down and everyone's going to be saying well we're past peak inflation the reason why that's going to happen is because the new numbers follow me on this the new numbers are building on old numbers that were already inflated so you're not going in you're not you're not measuring it from a hundred 100 you're measuring it from 108. right so what is the increase of 108. right so let me give you this this is a real world example this is actually what happened okay if you bought something in july 2020 at 100 okay okay in july 2021 inflation was at 5.4 percent so that was costing you 105 dollars and 40 cents okay this new number which is an eight well it's down so i should pay you'd think 103 103 or 104 right no it's up 8.5 from 105.40 so the new number the thing that used to cost a hundred dollars two years ago now costs and fourteen dollars and thirty six cents so your prices are doesn't sound down eighteen percent that's the inflation number from our normal prices fourteen point three six percent and the administration is going to spend all day bragging about that and it is and you're going to go into the store and you say wait a minute these prices aren't any lower they're all higher in fact they're 14 higher on average and you will be right and they will be bragging about it that's the rest of your day everybody boys and girls get together and realize these idiots are gonna come out here and say this all day because they think you are so stupid you just might believe it and they know they're lying and they're going to do it anyway that's the rest of your day average people don't know that and they know it they know it they know it the average person has no idea that what cost a hundred dollars last year was 108 and today because of the inflation you go up from the 108. it's not it's not going back towards 100 it's adding when they say 2 percent inflation is our target that means prices always go up every year by two percent that means your dollar is becoming that's why something cost a dime you know in 1940. i want that uh beautiful cadillac over there all right dollar and a half now it's 185 000 all inflation that's

dxmTJDFsbxM,2.0,0,welcome back if you've been to the grocery store or the gas station or anywhere where you literally buy anything recently you probably noticed something and that's that stuff costs more and of course there is a word for this it's inflation that's how economists refer to an increase in the price of goods and services one of the ways we measure inflation is via the consumer price index basically economists look at the price of everyday things that people buy things like groceries gas clothes they bundle all of that together and they see how prices change over time so in the west region which includes oregon prices are up six percent from october of last year so something that costs a hundred dollars last year might cost 106 dollars today and you might be thinking that doesn't sound like a lot and there's no way that gas prices are only up six percent and you're right remember six percent refers to the average for all prices in this fixed bundle of goods and services but inflation has hit some industries way harder than others meat and poultry prices are up almost 15 percent from october of last year it's something you might have noticed when you bought your thanksgiving turkey and if you bought a used car recently you're definitely feeling it too those prices are up more than 26 from this time last year and something we've heard from a lot of you gas prices are skyrocketing up nearly 43 percent since october of 2020. so the question is why is this happening and more importantly how do we make it stop so we asked josh laner an economist with the state of oregon what is causing this rise in prices and you know as you might have learned back in high school if you were paying better attention than me it has to do with supply and demand we're spending 15 more than we used to and so that means our supply chains are struggling not because they're moving record volumes of goods and delivering them to our doorstep but we're trying to buy even more than we can deliver so that's one of those root causes so it's really supply chain bottlenecks because the consumer demand is so strong should have said paid better attention than i that was good in english class that's embarrassing in other words though we are buying things faster than suppliers can make them and get them to us and that's obviously making things more expensive labor is hard to find materials cost more and we all pay the price so how long could this last well actually laner seems cautiously optimistic well i think you know we're going to see inflation sort of peak and come down i think as as those supply chain bottlenecks get fixed a little bit certainly on the other side of the holiday shopping season uh the question is where does it ultimately settle right the federal reserve would like to see it settle at two percent uh if it settles in that two or three percent range i think you know we'll we'll go on about our economic lives if it settles more in the four or five percent range um then then we have an interesting situation where the federal reserve may have to step in and raise rates faster than anticipated to cool off the economy so that may not be much relief to you watching at home every day things we all need to survive are more expensive and we're all feeling it but you know we put a post out on facebook just to let everybody vent a little bit and we asked you where you've noticed the rise in prices the most brad said bread coffee i gaze occasionally in the meat market chicken and pork remain affordable but beef i won't be throwing a steak on the grill anytime soon yeah we don't blame you,0.03,0.88,0.09,0.9912,0.13559322033898305,0.2033898305084746,0.05084745762711865,0.15254237288135594,0.13559322033898305,0.03389830508474576,0.0847457627118644,0.2033898305084746,0.9386609429686995,0.8463085320310255

life flares may now be a relic of the 20th century but some economists fear a return to high inflation the likes of which have not been seen for more than 40 years inflation is on the rise inflation inflation is a real concern and since the start of 2021 it has been rising steadily across the world inflation could be a lot less temporary than some of the central banks seem to think it is we're experiencing a number of novel developments that we have rarely observed in the past the cause now to growing concerns about the deadly coronavirus the pandemic has created a set of highly unusual economic conditions high inflation is detrimental to a healthy economy if it lasts longer it will affect the stock market it will affect consumers it will affect the economy a lot if inflation continues to rise what effect will it have on the stock market and your wealth when covert 19 started global lockdown markets plummeted you must stay at home do not travel abroad you could describe it as panic with investors dumping all sorts of risk assets including stocks goodness look at those numbers there an economic shock of unknowable scale is upon us fears of covey 19 grid the nation we were seeing fairly vicious falls almost every day the pandemic disrupted global supply chains production lines came to a standstill shipping stalled and air freight were grounded i think plenty of people thought that this could well be the start of a bear market but within five weeks something extraordinary happened the s p 500 which tracks the 500 largest companies in america had plummeted in march 2020 but it soon rallied and its value doubled over the next 18 months it felt like it almost shrugged off the effects of the corona virus or factored it in very quickly and it was back to business as usual lockdowns meant that people were spending less than before the pandemic at the same time governments were taking unprecedented steps to recharge their economies the single biggest economic relief the largest emergency of stimulus for the agencies time in our history the government is going to help to pay people's wages in the us alone the government has allocated more than four trillion dollars on stimulus funding congress adopted an approach that was aimed at supporting incomes of u.s families across the u.s and the idea was that in the presence of massive job losses the key intent was to support income all of this fiscal stimulus really supercharged consumer spending we saw central banks lower interest rates so the cost of borrowing is low and qe quantitative easing you know effectively pumping money into the economy a lot of which finds its way into markets to try and prop up and avoid any sort of massive crash john q has a private little nest egg his practical nature tells him it ought to do more than collect moths in a world of low interest rates consumers look elsewhere for better returns in their investments what are you going to do with your cash you don't want to leave it in the bank if you sold off in the worry of a bear market you're getting not very much return leaving it in a savings account so it's going to find its way into the stock market but the pandemic limited the supply of goods and since economies have reopened supply has been playing catch-up with that new-found surge in demand that has led to a rapid increase in inflation we saw the categories like motor vehicles like cars see a rapid acceleration in prices and in inflation it means your dollar or pound or yen won't buy as much tomorrow as it did today these lines chart the price of the two most popular oil stocks west texas intermediate and brent crude after falling to historic lows in april 2020 the prices of both types of oil have recovered sharply we have not seen supply of oil come back to its precovet level we've seen restraint on the front of opec and we've seen restraint on the u.s front in terms of oil production crude oil prices and natural gas prices have really surged the heads of a number of central banks have used cautious language this year saying that inflation is a transient thing or that we think it's going to be temporary their right to calm fears psychology plays a role in all of this too i don't know why i'm telling you this i'm a dentist you're the psychoanalyst if consumers fear long-term higher rates of inflation it can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy was that fair doctor tell me honestly what you think as they quickly spend to avoid higher prices in the future in that environment we are in what is called the price spiral and essentially this risks having runaway inflation we're not in that inflationary psychology right now traditionally central banks have controlled inflation by raising interest rates which makes borrowing more expensive their real fear is hyperinflation examples of which are strewn through history in these cases currencies became worthless no one is suggesting that any major economies are heading for hyperinflation but any period of higher inflation does have a knock-on effect on the stock market historically inflation can spell bad news for company stocks take a look at the dow jones index it measures 30 of the best performing companies in the us the red line charts its performance over the last 14 years between 2007 and 2011 when the us rate of inflation thus the blue line moved above three percent the index reacted negatively first in 2008 when inflation spiked during the subprime mortgage crisis the dow lost almost half its value and again in 2011 when an inflation increase was soon followed by a weaker index value when it comes to periods of higher inflation markets and investing can get a lot trickier some stocks traditionally outperform in times of higher inflation duke university in north carolina recently published a paper looking at historical returns over the past 95 years of different u.s equity sectors when inflation moved above 5 researchers focused on eight sustained periods of inflation from 1926 to 2020 when normal demand and supply patterns were jolted by global conflict we are determined to preserve our freedom no matter what the cost oil embargoes oil reserves are running out revolution and economic booms the legislative process to put america back on the road economic health is now fully underway of course historical trends are never a guarantee of future performance but the researchers found that across all sectors energy stocks delivered the best positive annual returns companies that produce gas that produce oil that produce renewable energy they will all be thriving during inflationary times but it is because inflation is caused by increase in energy prices soft commodities such as corn wheat fruit or livestock have also historically held or increased their stock prices and this is holding true today since january 2021 the three best performing soft commodities have soared in price the researchers at juke university found that commodities offered on average a 14 return on investments during periods of high inflation historically the fate of bank stocks during periods of high inflation has been hard to gauge how much are you going to start off with five shillings good when inflation hits there is an expectation of an interest rate hike from central banks so in theory banks should benefit from that because an interest rate hike makes it more profitable for banks to lend money well i think we can make you this long will the bank need security no i don't think so inflationary pressure however can also signal that an economy is in difficulty ideal conditions for debt defaults to arise this seems okay banks are very very embedded in that economic cycle dynamics so they actually might get hit by the sort of recession that may follow an inflation spike then there are the less flashy age-old stocks which typically offer steady but not spectacular growth rates these are known as value stocks as investors become a bit more concerned about the economy and the effect that higher inflation could have on it they could turn away from perhaps some of the more aggressive go-getter tech type stocks for example and look to a more traditional blue chip dividend yield slightly safer play we took a look at the top three growth stocks and the top three value stocks based on index weight according to the s p growth and value index we studied the relationship between stock price and inflation since 2007 when the rate of inflation moved above two percent the price of these growth stocks tends to decrease more quickly than the price of the value stocks as the rate of inflation increases technology stocks could suffer if we had higher inflation some of them anyway clearly some of the big names if we take the likes of facebook amazon netflix google they weren't around in the 1970s when we had runaway inflation so it's difficult to know how they will be impacted instead of focusing on potential growth in times of inflation investors tend to look at how much leverage or debt a specific company or stock has taken on value stocks are typically better placed in this respect it's unlikely that rich economies are headed back to the kind of double-digit inflation last seen in the late 70s i want to have a frank talk with you tonight about our most serious domestic problem inflation we are going to see some cooling of inflation but inflation is likely to remain persistently higher than it was in the decade before the coveted crisis if we do see interest rates gradually get ratcheted up that could be perhaps something of a bigger shock than stock markets were expecting and could be a reason for people to perhaps head for the exits gradually on stock markets a more likely scenario is a period of what's known as stagflation where inflation rises at the same time as the economy slows either way there will be opportunities for traders and investors 78.77% of retail

CJUbXY5KqgU,2.0,0,inflation is the highest it's been in four decades which has cause for alarm and reason for lawmakers to address it head-on and in the two days since senate democrats passed the inflation reduction act and sent it to the house for its deliberation we've heard all the snippets and sound bites on how the bill is not really what they say it is of course nearly all of that talk is coming from those who voted against it like idaho senators mike crapo and jim risch they say despite its name the 700 page bill is not about reducing inflation but just increasing taxes and scrutiny over who is paying them president biden promised those increased taxes would not be imposed on those making less than 400 thousand a year critics say the president is wrong and the act will actually raise taxes on everyone senator risch claiming such in his explanation on why he voted against it on sunday these tax hikes won't affect just the highest tax bracket americans making as little as 30 thousand dollars per year will pay more to federal government because of this bill and senator crapo saying nearly the same thing a week ago and during the 10-year period the average tax burden increases would increase for nearly every income category crapo by the way quoting the joint committee on taxation who put out the review of the bill a committee on which grepo happens to sit well those two statements solicited these questions from you laura asking us to explain senator crapo's comment that anyone making thirty thousand or more on taxes on or will have their taxes increased under the bill where is he seeing this increase rick wanting us to tell him how the act will impact families that have thirty thousand dollar income as rishi stated and kim what can you please fact check rish's comment about nude act about the new act increasing taxes for folks as low as 30 000 well we reached out to both senators crapo and risch and neither responded to our questions or requests for an interview but chief political reporter joe perez was able to speak with a boise accountant to in fact fact checked fact check those claims about taxes going up for those making less than 400 thousand a year national conversation continues to center on the inflation reduction act and depending on what side of the aisle you're on you may hear two very different conversations a major question though about the act does it keep the promise of president joe biden who said the act would not raise taxes on people making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year critics say no supporters say yes so we went nonpartisan for an analysis on the act boise cpa jeff beebe says he expects calls soon from clients i will this week once it really starts getting into the press i'll have people start to call me a major question he will likely get how will this act impact taxes we asked bibi to explain some of the language inside of it we cash rates aren't changing as part of the the uh act but there are some things that for corporations are raising taxes which they'll end up passing through to consumers so while you may not be paying taxes directly you'll be paying more for it while the individual tax rates for those making less than four hundred thousand dollars doesn't change the act does include a new 15 percent minimum tax on corporations that earn more than a billion dollars in annual profits the tax works to focus on some 200 u.s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some companies that end up paying no taxes at all due to clever maneuvering experts say don't expect the major corporations to bite the bullet on paying new taxes you take amazon as an example very early on amazon didn't make any money for years so they had a big net operating loss carryover that they've been using up now that they're profitable but it still is an offset that was legal to use but very unpopular politically so it's focused on companies like that or that they're reinvesting large amounts of their income into other things that are deductions they don't want all these deductions getting away they're not going to just take a hit to the bottom line they're going to pass it through to consumers so what could that look like usually it would be a a price increase it might be lowering the rate of wage increases although with our current environment of tight employment you can't mess with people's wages too much it's going to be in price increase so while tax rates might not change low and medium earning americans could see a cost associated with the new act but tax credits built into the act for things like green energy and electric cars or medicare benefits well those also are supposed to offset those costs bibi says he's also watching another part of the act an 80 billion dollar investment into the internal revenue service the irs the goal is to crack down on dishonest tax filings that cost the country millions of dollars well they're talking about hiring up to 80 000 employees which is almost doubling the size of the irs and which will make a big impact on irs audits the irs has kind of a tough job they enforce a very unpopular law everybody understands that the government needs money to operate they just don't want it to be my money i want to be somebody else's money so the irs has more resources i guess the logic here would be okay less less under reporting right yeah they'll go after that under reporting and that's under reporting from individuals is 250 billion it's much larger for from individuals than corporations or payroll taxes and who's that going to go to that's mostly going to be people that make under four hundred thousand dollars a year again that's on a tax increase because that's tax law that exists it's just people are paying it and the irs is going to try and collect it it'll be focused on people making it under 400 000 because there are more more of those people than there are over 400 000 and there's a lot of i guess intricacy to get into this entire thing and of course we don't have time to go through it right now but if you wanted to read more and i recommend you do go to our website right now ktvb.com we have an explanation of what's in the act how it works why it works that way as well as we track this whole thing through brian it's important to know this is non-god to the pri the president's desk that still technically has to pass another house over in congress when the president does sign it that would start triggering you know differences for cpas across the country they're going to have to look at things but we'll wait and watch for now and again we'd love to sit down with senators crepe and rich to find out get a little bit more explanation as to why they voted no and why they're saying the saying the things they're saying about it all right thanks

MlSkdslNZVc,1.0,0,everybody welcome back to the financial freedom show my name is rob berker in today's video we're going to take a look at tips versus eye bonds tips treasury inflation protected securities and eye bonds they're both bonds that help us hedge the risk of inflation but they're very very different from one another so here's what we're going to do first we're going to start with the similarities we're going to look at five ways uh in which they're they're very similar then we're going to look at eight ways they're different and the differences are really important to understand and then we're going to finish up i'm going to walk through a couple of my own thoughts on the differences and how i'm using or not using them in my own portfolio and then as a bonus tip at the end i'm going to talk about how we can use one of them if we want to to help save for child's education there are some tax advantages built into one of them so let's get started and uh with the similarities number one is they're both bonds issued by the us government so that means there's effectively no what's called credit risk that is risk of default or at least it's about the safest thing we have access to today so they're both issued by the u.s government that's the first thing the second similarity is they do both hedge or protect us against unexpected increases in inflation that's kind of the reason we might want to invest in either a tips or an ipod they protect us from inflation now as we'll see in a minute they protect us in different ways but they do both hedge against inflation and the third thing and related to that is they both use the consumer price index technically the cpi for all urban consumers the cpi-u that's the index they use for their adjustments based on inflation again we'll look at that in a little more detail in just a minute um the fourth similarity is they both can be purchased through treasury direct let me just show you that briefly treasury direct is the part of the federal government the federal government website treasurydirect.gov we'll look at it again in just a minute but you can purchase both tips and i bonds directly from the federal government through treasury direct it's not the only way you can buy tips as we'll see in a minute but you can you can buy them both through treasury direct and then the the fifth similarity is they're both exempt uh from state and local taxes so they have a tax benefit as well when you get your interest payments as small as they may be they are exempt from state and local taxes so those are five similarities let's go right to the differences because that's really where some important things come to light the first is how we buy now i mentioned just a minute ago you can buy them both through treasury direct but here's the deal that's effectively the only way to buy eye bonds you can't buy eye bonds through say an etf or a mutual fund they're not sold on what's called the secondary market you have to buy them directly from the federal government tips on the other hand are traded on the secondary market and so you can for example invest in an etf a tips etf or mutual fund vanguard offers them most of the major mutual fund uh companies offer them so in that sense tips are frankly a little easier to buy than i bonds and that has some implications as we'll see in just a minute now related to that the second difference is the purchase limits when you buy an i-bond you're limited to ten thousand dollars in i bonds a year when you buy them directly through treasury direct you know if you're married both spouses can can buy ten thousand dollars in eye bonds but but you're limited in that regard now you can boost that a little bit if you get a refund each year you can use up to five thousand dollars of your refund to buy eye bonds as well so i guess that would bring your total to fifteen thousand but the key really is that with ibonds there is a limit uh to how much you can buy each year with tips as a practical matter for you and i there's really no limit at all technically if you're an institutional buyer they're going to be limits but for you and i as a practical matter you can buy you know as much in the way of tips as you want so that's the second important difference the third difference is how the two adjust for uh inflation and let's start with eye bonds what ibots do is they have sort of you can think of it as two interest rates they have what they call a fixed rate and then they have what's called an inflation rate the fixed rate is determined when you buy uh the bond and it's uh it stays the same just as you would think fixed it doesn't change so uh right now the fixed rate on an i bond and let me show you this may or may not surprise you it is zero percent we can go all the way up to here we go may of 2021 as you can see they set this every six months in may and november the fixed rate is zero percent now that doesn't sound very good but now we have to look at the inflation rate this two adjusts every six months and based on the cpi and we can see that currently it's 1.77 percent that's the six-month rate so if it stays the same in november you would effectively double that to what 3.54 percent and to calculate your your your interest rate on an ipod you add the fixed rate to the inflation rate so effectively on an annual basis as i record this video uh i bonds are paying just over three and a half percent but again come november uh depending on what the cpi does uh that inflation rate could go up or down you can see over a number of years as you look on the screen here the rates have varied they can even be negative that is a possibility but we'll come back to that that's just uh the inflation rate and i will leave a link to this page uh below the video now uh with uh tips it kind of is the opposite they don't actually change the interest rate what they do is they adjust the principal balance that the interest rate is applied to so if there's inflation the principal balance gets increased and then whatever the the rate is it gets applied to that increased balance if there happens to be deflation and there is from time to time the principal balance goes uh down and that's how they adjust for inflation now one important thing to keep in mind is that with the tip although the principal balance can go up and down with inflation and deflation when the bond matures you'll never get less than the face amount of the bonds even if there's deflation every year you own the tips bond you'll never get back less than you put in so that that's good but you have to understand with tips they adjust for inflation by adjusting the principal balance all right related to all that is the fourth difference and that's the interest rates and i want to go back uh to this tab here and you saw where we have this fixed rate of zero percent currently here it is and we have the current inflation rate of 1.77 but if you come down here you'll notice some negative rates uh this was back in may may 1st of 2015. so here's the deal with i bonds you'll take the fixed rate and you'll add it to the inflation rate and whatever that amount is that's your your rate for the next six months however i bonds will never go negative if the inflation rate is negative and the fixed rate is zero the interest rate applied for that next six month period will just be zero interest rates for i bonds never go below zero with tips the rates can and do and currently are negative and let me just show you an example of that this is a vanguard short term you can see it here inflation protected securities index fund this is tips again remember they can be bought inside an etf for a mutual fund and that's good but if we go down here and we look at what's called the sec yield right here it's the the the basically the income that the fund paid over the 30 day period ending i guess as of july 29th you can see right here it's negative a negative two point four four percent so tips the yields the the interest on them can go negative that's an important thing to keep in mind we'll come back to it as a matter of fact now the fifth difference has to do with taxes with an eye bond you can defer the taxes until either the bond matures or you decide to redeem and and sell your bond back to the u.s government you can defer the taxes until then if you want to with tips you can't interest and principal adjustments are taxed annually which as a general rule makes tips more ideal for tax advantaged accounts than taxable accounts so that's a fifth difference to keep in mind and that brings us to number six and that's the maturity i-bonds have one maturity one length and it's 30 years you can't buy a 10-year i-bond they're all 30 years with tips 5 10 or 30-year maturities so you have you have some choices and for that reason you'll often see funds or etfs that are either short-term tips or intermediate or long-term tips so you have some flexibility there but with i bonds it's just 30 years right number seven there are some penalties and restrictions if you try to sell an i bond that we need to know about so first of all you cannot redeem an i-bond for the first 12 months the government won't bite back from you invest in an i-bond you're stuck with it for 12 months that's the first thing and then the second thing is after the 12 months if you sell it you're going to pay a three-month penalty worth three months worth of interest until you've waited a full five years after five years you can sell it without penalty but if you sell it before five years you're going to get a penalty of three months interest so that's something to keep in mind in some ways it makes it similar to the penalty for a certificate of deposit i personally given the current interest rates that you're getting on an i-bond that three-month penalty doesn't concern me too much because it's still clobbering what you can earn say on a savings account but it's important and it's something to keep in mind as you're making your own decisions on how to invest your money with tips you know there are no similar penalties you can buy and sell tips on the secondary market there are no restrictions like there are with eye bonds now the eighth and final difference is that as you may know particularly if you watch my bonds 101 video as interest rates rise and fall the value of existing bonds go in the opposite direction so if interest rates go up the value of an existing bond would go down if interest rates go down the value of an existing bond goes up however with i bonds remember you can't sell them or buy them you know in the open market you can only exchange with the federal government and the value of the bond basically stays the same if you want to sell your bond your eye bond back to the government you want to redeem it they're going to give you the face value it doesn't matter if interest rates have gone up or down you're going to get whatever the value of the bond is if you own tips and you sell them the actual value there could be they could be selling at a premium or a discount so for example if you think interest rates are going to fall it's kind of hard to believe in the current market they would do that but you know i've been surprised before on interest rates so if they fell the value of an existing bond any bond really but tips would go up so that's something to keep in mind tips values will change as interest rates change value of an i bond won't so those are the eight differences they're pretty significant and now what does that all mean how should we think about all of those differences as we try to think about our own portfolios so a few things to keep in mind when it comes to just asset allocation if you want to allocate something to an inflation protected bond something that's going to hedge against inflation i think is a practical matter tips are probably the answer because they can be bought and sold through etfs and mutual funds if you have a portfolio of any size and you want to allocate 10 20 whatever it might be to an inflation protected bond it's going to be really hard to do that with eye bonds given you have to buy them directly from the government and there are limits on how much you can buy each year tips are just much much easier having said that i personally have moved out of tips i've owned them in the past i just can't stomach the negative rates yes i like the idea of having investments that hedge against inflation but it seems to me an awfully expensive price to pay for that inflation protection and from my perspective stocks are pretty decent hedge against inflation not in the short term in the short term inflation and higher interest rates will clobber stocks but over the long term stocks have historically anyway significantly outperformed inflation so i'm just not a big believer in investing in tips today given the negative yields now with eye bonds can they serve as an emergency fund well again you've got to be able to get over that limit on selling them for 12 months if you can deal with that and how you structure your finances then probably not a bad alternative although frankly a savings account is probably just an easier way to go having said that i do own a little bit in eye bonds and i do plan to buy more this year both for me and my wife we're going to buy the limit of ten thousand dollars because i think the rates are just really good right now and um i do suspect in november the result will be pretty solid rates as well although i guess we'll see so i do have some eye bonds in my portfolio and i am increasing that this year although then again given the limits on how much i can buy it's a really really small fraction of our overall portfolio but such is life there you go now i did promise you a bonus tip and that comes to the question of education it turns out there's some tax benefits if you use i bonds to pay for education this does not apply to tips and let me show you and again i'll leave a link to what i'm showing you below the video this is a page from treasury direct and it walks through how you can use eye bonds to pay for education and avoid taxes uh on the interest now there are a number of sort of hoops you have to jump through they're all right here some of them may surprise you for example this one one of the qualifications up is that you were 24 or older before your savings bond uh was issued and you have to use the proceeds of the bond for education expenses for either yourself your spouse or your dependents and as you can see there are other requirements as well so before you make any decisions it's really important that you understand what these requirements are and that you meet them but i wanted to point that out i bonds can be an effective part of a broader a plan to pay for a child's education so there you go we've got the similarities and the differences and some strategies when it comes to tips versus eye bonds if you have any questions or comments leave them below the video i'll be happy to help you out any way i can and until next time remember the best thing money can buy is financial

TuluNRhhb0E,3.0,0,inflation in the united states hasn't been this high in 40 years we're at seven percent inflation meaning that if you didn't get a raise last year you're now seven percent less able to afford goods and services than you were last year and the blame game has started whose fault is it is it fiscally irresponsible policymakers corporate greed putin's foreign aggression as it turns out none of these are the right places to look so how is inflation controlled and what does it mean for our economies and our wallets i'm cameron harwick a professor of economics at suny brockport let's break it down inflation is how economists keep track of how fast average prices are rising in an economy prices meaning it's plural a common mistake people make when thinking about inflation is just looking at one price and usually that's the price of gas but gas prices are a particularly bad metric for inflation because its day-to-day price is so dependent on industry-specific supply factors so feel free to blame putin for high gas prices but if you're looking to know why all prices are rising across the board you have to look beyond any particular industry that's also why when political figures like elizabeth warren blame inflation on corporate greed or when president biden blames it on excessive and unfair profits that might explain high prices in certain industries but it doesn't explain rising prices even in competitive industries did corporations get seven percent greedier last year are our industry seven percent more monopolized than last year of course not and if a company could get seven percent more profit just by raising prices why wouldn't they have done that last year because they can't even monopolies are limited by market conditions now usually we think of the price of a good as reflecting the supply and demand of that good but it's important to remember that a price reflects the supply and demand of two things not just the good that you're buying but also the money that you use to pay for it and the supply of money is the key to understanding inflation since money is used to pay for everything in an economy the supply of money impacts the price of everything and the supply of money is determined by the monetary policy of the federal reserve the central bank of the united states their job is to make sure that the supply of money matches the demand for money and it's a delicate tightrope if the federal reserve undershoots you get deflation and recession which means that prices will fall and unemployment rises and if it overshoots you get inflation and shortages throughout the supply chain when the covet 19 pandemic first hit the demand for money rose but the federal reserve overshot with the supply of money but you can't blame that on the president or congress as many might think now the government did respond in multiple ways to the pandemic including sending out stimulus checks and some people blame those checks for increasing consumer spending and therefore causing inflation but the checks themselves don't affect the supply of money and they don't necessarily increase total spending after all that money has to come from somewhere and congress doesn't have the ability to print money since the federal reserve is operationally independent of congress congress can't ask the federal reserve to print more money for them either and good thing because they'd likely be running the presses all the time so why did the federal reserve overshoot if it wasn't to pay for the stimulus checks back in 2008 there's a crash in the housing market that spread to the rest of the economy and when the economy gets rocky people get cautious and want to hang on to their money rather than spending it in response the federal reserve created huge amounts of money trying to match that demand but it wasn't enough and for years they undershot and unemployment stayed high the federal reserve doesn't want to repeat that so at the beginning of the pandemic they were much more willing to err on the side of inflation now as the demand for money falls back to normal levels during the recovery the fed is scrambling to undo a lot of that expansion now with inflation at seven percent it's natural to wonder will the u.s lose control of inflation and go the way of venezuela with an inflation rate in the tens of millions that's what we would call hyperinflation and that happens when the government deficit is so bad that the only way they can pay their bills is to force the central bank to print money for them now while the us does have an uncomfortably large national debt there's no sign that congress will have to rely on the federal reserve like that anytime soon in fact the federal reserve has been cautiously contracting for months now they don't want to go too quickly or we could land in a recession that's worse than the inflation it's happened before in 1980 when they tried to get the 14 percent inflation of the 70s under control but if the federal reserve doesn't make any huge missteps we should expect to see inflation fall slowly over the next year or two until we're back at their target rate of about two percent if you're interested in learning more about the economy money markets or macroeconomic trends check out the department of accounting economics and finance at suny

Vh5FmZRjBpo,1.0,0,the UK economy is in a state of low growth and high inflation or stagflation and that's why I bought an inflation-linked Bond so in this video I'll talk about why I did that but also how I did it it wasn't easy and also I'll talk about what I hope the reward is going to be now don't forget if you do enjoy our videos please do like this and also subscribe to our channel that way you won't miss any new ones so let's look at how and why I bought inflation Bonds in a bit more detail let's begin with stagflation in the UK beside me you can see GDP growth in the UK going back to 1955 and notice how it breaks down into two phases the first phase is from 1955 to the global financial crisis where growth averaged 2.4 percent notice after that there was a kind of leg downwards and we never got back to that long-term Trend not only that but the rate of growth also slowed down to 2.1 percent then we got the pandemic which took a big chunk out of GDP but we did bounce back and now it seems to have kind of flounded again if we compare growth with the United States you can see that during the pandemic the US also took a hit but it wasn't as deep as the one in the UK and if you look across G7 the other rich countries of the world the patent that you see is also one of a shallower fall and a more rapid recovery and whereas U.S growth seems to have recovered in the UK it actually seems to have leveled off which is quite worrying turning to inflation if we look at UK inflation relative to other countries ours is now looking quite sticky the latest UK print of inflation as I make this video was 10.1 percent that's above the EU average of 9.9 it's well above Germany France and also the US where disinflation a falling rate of inflation looks to be very clearly the case now in the UK there's a lot of upward pressure on wages at the moment so we look at the real wage growth you can see that there were long periods in the past when wages were falling in real terms after the global financial crisis and we never really recovered from that there was a period of real wage growth after the pandemic which was quite significant but now we've gone back to negative real wage growth if we look at nominal wage growth where we haven't adjusted for inflation what's particularly worrying in the UK right now is that wage growth is very high in nominal terms now that's because of successful wage negotiations but also a very tight labor market as we'll see in a moment now the prospect of a price wage spiral where prices Chase wages and wages Chase prices is actually a material risk in the UK and that's partly because the UK labor Market's very tight the same is true in other countries of course but if we look at the number of vacancies job vacancies per unemployed person that's at a very elevated level in the UK right now it has come off its peak but still remains elevated it I think part of the problem is that if you look at the number of economically active workers in the UK that's this red line that seems to have plateaued so we're not getting any new workers entering the market and yet at the same time the number of jobs the number of available jobs has actually increased upwards very rapidly so we've got a fixed pool of Labor which is static we've got increasing jobs which those workers could do but we can't satisfy that demand for workers so of course having greater demand for workers than supply of workers pushes up the price of Labor and that means in the UK at least that we're going to have an upward pressure on wages and that could make inflation yet more sticky if the economy is in a state of stagflation how can we deal with that as investors well previously I did a video about the investment clock as it's called now all this does is to arrange growth and inflation onto the two axes of this graph so you've got Rising inflation towards the right falling inflation towards the left Rising growth going upwards and falling growth going downwards so we're pretty much in this bottom right quadrant which is stagflation in the UK and in the fixed income space the best place to invest in that kind of environment is an inflation-linked bonds so that's why I decided to buy inflation linked to UK government bonds or guilds and these are also called linkers and this is the inflation linked bond which I bought now you can think of the certificate beside me kind of like a birth certificate which was issued by the UK debt management office it publishes one of these for each of the bonds rigid issues and of course the whole point for the existence of this bond is to raise money for for the treasury in this case it raised 1.5 billion pounds now the birth date of the bond the issue date was October 2012 and the maturity date of the bond when people get their money back that's in March of 2024. in the interim this thing's going to be a very small coupon and the percentage of the face value of the bond which the bond pays every year is just 1 8 of a percent it's absolutely tiny however what's special about this bond is that it's going to be linked to the rate of inflation so notice this reference Index this very large number at the bottom here because that's going to crop up later on it's very important for this Bond so let's pretend initially that this is not an inflation-licked bond this is what the cash flows would look like if that was the case so for a normal guilt what you'd get is you'd pay a hundred pounds for the bond on day one when it's issued this was in 2012 and that was on the issue date of October the 12th 2012 then at maturity on March the 22nd 2024 you get your hundred pounds back and you'd get any final coupon that's paid now between the issue date and the maturity date you're going to get very small coupons these are paid every six months so you get half of that 1 8 so a sixteenth of a percent every six months and a sixteenth of a percent of a hundred is going to be six and a quarter Pence every six months now I only bought this Bond on March the 14th of this year so I'm only entitled to the final one two three four coupons and the return of the principal but you can probably guess the one I'm really interested in is that return of principle because that's the really big cash flow the coupons are almost zero but because this is an inflation linked Bond these are not the cash flows that you actually get and that's because of something magical called uplift the whole point of inflation link bonds is that the principal and the coupons rise in line with inflation and what we care about is the cumulative rate of inflation since the issued date of the bond now it's not CPI inflation which these bonds are linked to there was discussion of moving it to CPI but for now it's still RPI retail price inflation which is also published by the ons the offers for National statistics in the UK and you can see the rate of that year on year going back to before 1990. notice that at the moment it's 13.5 percent which is considerably higher than the 10.1 percent for CPI inflation now to actually work out the amount of uplift how much the cash flows increase over time is not easy it actually comes with a lag so you actually look back three months three calendar months from the date of the cash flow to the value of RPI to work out what the uplift is relative to the date on which the bond was issued now if the cash flow doesn't fall on the first car and a day of a month then you have to do an interpolation which is quite complex but it depends on something called a reference index and that's for the first calendar day of the month in which the day falls for the cash flow and the index for the first calendar day of the next month and you round it to five decimal places so immediately you can see why some people are reluctant to buy inflation-laked bonds they are quite technical but the other key Point here is that for the future cash flows I don't know what I'm going to get if I buy a normal Government Bond and I hold it to maturity I know precisely how much my cash flows will be and precisely when they'll be paid in contrast with an inflation linked Bond you don't know what this reference index is going to be in the future you just got to guess what the rate of inflation will be so in that sense you're kind of Leaping into the unknown if inflation's more than expected then you'll get more money if inflation is less than expected you'll get less but the key point is that whatever inflation is RPI inflation at least it'll be linked to that index now our pension craft Community get access to a range of trackers and one of them is the macroeconomic tracker this is what it looks like and I've recently added several new tabs specifically for the UK so I've now got UK guilt yields those are often difficult to find so if you do buy single nominal government bonds this is the yield you'll lock in and at the moment you can see that those have risen quite sharply for the point of view of linkers the interesting tab is inflation so you can look at UK CPI inflation which you can see is very high you can also look at the tight labor market and employment's very low but if you're going to buy inflation linked bonds something called Break evens are very interesting this tells you what inflation has to average over the life of your bond in order to make an inflation-licked Bond worthwhile in other words what rate of inflation is baked into the price already if you think inflation will exceed that then it's worthwhile investing in an inflation-linked Bond and when I did that for the UK I certainly thought that it probably would be worthwhile so if you want to get access to this and you want to learn more

this Linker then just click on the link in the description below or just go to pensioncraft.com now as I say I don't really know what the rate of inflation is going to be over the remaining life of my bond so this is my guess as to what that return will be so this is the cumulative uplift for my bond since it was issued in 2012. now this Factor starts off at one initially there's no uplift because there was no inflation but then as we get each of these coupons every six months notice how gradually we accumulate greater and greater uplift so the coupons will be gradually increasing such that by the time I bought the bond this was in March of this year the uplift was about 50 percent now if we look at those recent cash flows the rate at which the cash flow has been growing the rate of growth of uplift due to RPI every six months with these numbers so you can see as the rate of inflation soared then we recently reached about seven or six percent annual growth in prices so what I've simply had to do is assume that inflation will decelerate as the bank of England says it will but because it's sticky I think that'll happen quite slowly so my educated guess for the remaining three six-month periods is we're going to get six percent three percent and two percent increase in RPI for every successive six month period is that just a guess yes it is and if that's the case these are the cash flows I'll receive I bought the bond when it had an uplift of about 50 so I paid about 150 and on the Redemption date in about one and a half years I'm going to receive about 166 pounds there'll also be some tiny coupon payments three of them each of them will be about 10 pence plus a final 10 pence coupon on the Redemption date if we combine all those cash flows I'm going to get an internal rate of return of about 7.6 percent which isn't too bad but the critical point is that this will keep up with the rate of inflation in the UK by definition now let's see the actual process of buying a Linker and it was not easy in order to do this I opened an account with interactive investor which offers single guilts but also single inflation linked bonds and I put it inside an item so I don't have to worry about capital gains or income in fact for UK guilts you don't have to pay Capital Gains anyway now while I could buy a guilt via the usual web interface just as you would for a stock or a fund I couldn't do that for my Linker so I actually had to call them up and right now I'm going to show you what that call was like they just basically throw a huge amount of information at you and you've just got to be absolutely clear as to what the price is to expect but the lady that did it was very good I have to say I'll press one to cancel a trade our advisors are working hard to answer your calls as quickly as possible [Music] interactive investor could I start by taking your account number please and how is it I can help today well I was hoping I could buy an index linked Treasury symbol for that please yes of course it's tr24 yes could I buy 5 000 pounds worth please and that'll be attempted to buy or attempting to invest on your behalf five thousand Towers in the um treasury United Kingdom government of 0.125 investing SNR 22nd and 3rd 2024 GBP guilt symbol tr24 and that'll be at Market best um at the web Commission of um 5.99 and if executed that'll be dealt on a two plus two yes please no but you're going to be famous because you were recorded on my YouTube channel so uh congratulations great thank you very much for your help take care bye-bye so if you do agree with me that the UK's in a state of stagflation and likely to stay there for some time then perhaps a Linker would make sense for you too all I'd say is make sure you understand it before you buy it never buy something which you don't understand but also you don't know what you're gonna get because the rate of inflation is unknown in the future now don't forget our offer if you want to

YD0qsufuf2E,2.0,0,so i was playing guitar and thinking about inflation like i usually do and it's kind of crazy to think that there are many reasons for inflation for example there's cost push inflation where if the wood for example on a guitar gets more expensive than the guitar manufacturer can pass that along as a cost increase to consumers but there's also something called demand poll inflation where if me and a bunch of other people want to buy guitars we might be willing to pay a higher price which means that the guitar manufacturer can meet us at that higher price point and that might be a good thing because it means that people are healthy and they can consume and the company could get more money to pay a higher wage to their worker but of course you don't want runaway inflation like we had in the 1970s where double-digit inflation was very quickly eroding people's purchasing power so it just goes to show that there's a lot of nuance to inflation,0.038,0.858,0.104,0.8932,0.0967741935483871,0.12903225806451613,0.0,0.25806451612903225,0.16129032258064516,0.06451612903225806,0.06451612903225806,0.22580645161290322,0.8770330450644045,0.822060353798127
SNg81S3mBSU,2.0,0,showing the consumer price index that's basically follows inflation it spiked to 4.2 percent compared to where we were a year ago that the economy is stronger but inflation also is much higher than expected and not as transitory monexica says inflation will be the number one market driver through year end inflation inflation inflation you hear that word everywhere these days but what does it actually mean let's save you a google search and answer what is inflation the technical explanation is a general systematic increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money but that's kind of technical so the short version is inflation happens when prices go up over time and the purchasing power of a dollar goes down inflation is a process of repeated ongoing increases across a broad set of prices it's not a one-time increase in prices for example you know if the price of tomatoes were to rise five percent because of a freeze that's not inflation it's also not a narrow set of prices going up for example you know prices of new or used cars going up because of a semiconductor shortage inflation is broad and it's repeated year after year so it's more of a process than a one-time shift the big difference here is it's more than noticing a single price increase everything starts to cost more so your money doesn't go as far some inflation is normal it doesn't hurt consumers if wages are going up by the same amount if wages are not going up by the same amount it does reduce purchasing power and and so what that means is consumers might have to cut back spending on other items or they may save less if their wages are not increasing at the same pace as inflation but i'd like to emphasize that some inflation actually is healthy and in fact the fed targets the federal reserve targets a moderate but positive amount of inflation which is two percent on an annual basis inflation is calculated using something called consumer price indexes that's basically how much more you're paying for the stuff you buy regularly over a period of time it's a so-called basket of consumer goods so what's in the basket it's things like housing costs basic food and drinks transportation health and personal care and things you spend money on for fun too so how does what we're seeing now compared to other times in history one good example that has some parallel to now is immediately after world war ii when we saw a surge in prices in the global economy the the global economy was recovering really fast it needed a lot of materials to rebuild that inflation didn't last prices leveled off or fell back as the economy recovered and so in many ways the supply chain issues that we're seeing now after the global economy basically shut down and then reopened are similar to that dynamic that we saw after world war ii the fed says the inflation we're seeing now is temporary because of the pandemic and i would say it's just very difficult for a complex global economy to go from completely shut down to operating on all cylinders and the pandemic has just caused a lot of you know congestion which is driving up shipping costs so the further we move away from the pandemic the more the economy will be able to adjust and we're likely to see some of these prices either stop going down stop going up excuse me or even go back down and inflation will slow you know inflation is one side effect of you know the the disruptions related to the pandemic but i think we should also think about how this recovery has been faster and stronger than prior recoveries it's come with more inflation but it's been faster and stronger and that's a really important point and and that's why we have higher inflation right now inflation is a scary word but as the pandemic eases there should be fewer uh disruptions and companies have every incentive to fix supply chain issues and restore smooth functioning to the economy you,0.047,0.848,0.105,0.9912,0.050505050505050504,0.10101010101010101,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.12121212121212122,0.09090909090909091,0.06060606060606061,0.24242424242424243,0.8347293871463726,0.7907356392204877

UZIFvCCSNcY,2.0,89,[Music] interest rates are rising in the UK again but what does this obscure number decided by a group of economists actually mean for you here's a clue there's much more to it than just Rising mortgage payments this is what the governor of the bank of England had to say on the 3rd of November we've increased bank rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3 percent into context this was the biggest single interest rate rise since the fall of the Berlin wall and will have a huge impact on the entire British economy so why are they Rising we've had years of low rates and cheap borrowing first things first one of the main issues here is inflation but what the hell is that to understand what interest rates do it's first important to understand inflation so most of us will find that the cost of products when we go to the supermarket the cost of our energy bills the cost of our housing has all increased and that's that's due to these inflationary pressures let's dig a Little Deeper inflation is hitting household budgets across the board but families food budgets are being hit particularly hard I journalist Katie Grant has analyzed the price of the humble tomato what does this staple food beloved by so many around the world tell us about inflation when we're looking at inflation it can be quite useful to look at something very specific that we all probably have in our fridges whereas previously they actually went up just sort of incrementally in price each year in the 12 months to September 2022 the price per kilogram of tomatoes went up by 22 tomatoes are really energy intensive um product to grow their grown-in greenhouses we we all know with our energy bills at home prices are going up wages have gone up there are labor shortages in the UK and Growers need to be more competitive in terms of what they're paying their staff and then finally the transportation of getting that to wholesalers and into supermarkets is going up because as we know fuel prices are very high at the moment so when the price of Food rises along with so many other products we need to survive whose responsibility is it to try and shield us from these Rising costs enter one of our main players the bank of England the bank of England is our Central Bank here in the UK it has an important role in keeping inflation at just two percent enough for the economy to grow but still low enough that your household finances don't take a huge hit so how do they maintain Financial stability that's where interest rates come in the bank sets What's called the bank rate probably one of the most important numbers in the British economy the bank rate affects How High Street Banks price borrowing and rewards for savings having a direct impact on what you or I pay for our mortgages and Loans this is the lever that the bank will pull to affect inflation the bank's monetary policy committee made up of nine members led by the bank's Governor Andrew Bailey reviews the bank rate around every six weeks and they've been steadily increasing the rate recently it's something we haven't seen for quite some time higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more lucrative the theory goes that this will encourage people to spend less lowering demand for goods and services eventually pulling down inflation you essentially reduce the supply of credit to the whole economy in one fail swoop so when people save as they're incentivized to do through higher interest rates the less money they have in their pockets to spend in shops on goods and services across the economy that decreases the rate at which prices rise and that's what the bank of England's intention is for increasing interest rates at the moment affects businesses ability to borrow to grow their businesses and invest in the economy it affects homeowners ability to keep the roof over their head and also diminishes their ability to spend money on other areas of the economy and invest in their own local economies by buying goods and services locally because their household budgets have been squeezed same goes for private renters okay so the bank of England are entirely responsible for the squeeze on people who have a mortgage or rent their home from someone who does hold up not so simple while they do decide the bank rate which has an impact on the interest rates we have access to there are other players in this and there are many factors outside their control remember that two percent Target of inflation the bank is trying to maintain that is set by the government and indeed most countries around the world aim for two percent as it's seen as a healthy balance for a stable economy but keeping to two percent is a tricky task and the bank of England aren't in control of all the factors globally Putin's war in Ukraine has had a big impact Russia is a key supplier of oil and gas and Ukraine is a key transit route for much of that oil and gas to European markets so the price for oil and gas have gone up markets have reacted to this uncertainty by adding a risk premium so prices go up even more that puts up our household bills and the prices of many products such as Tomatoes driving inflation this is clearly not something the bank of England could do something about but then there are domestic issues the bank of England does have a role in Liz truss's mini budget promised a major round of tax cuts which would have put more money in people's pockets but that would have encouraged them to spend just so the bank of England was trying to slow down people's spending to curb inflation in the market turmoil that followed the mini budget the bank helped stabilize the economy it rushed to buy government debt to bring stability to the market while also giving a statement on its plans to tackle inflation bye you guessed it raising interest rates trust's plans have now been canned by a successor Rishi Suna but the interest rate increases issued in the wake of the mini budget remain and with inflation running around 10 percent this could mean even more rate hikes are on the horizon if inflation increases we can certainly expect to see further increases in interest rates but irrespective of that almost all forecasts at the moment point to much higher interest rates over the next 12 months or so this would have been happening anyway in all likelihood but the rate of those increases has been sped up quite significantly by last month's disastrous fiscal statement so I think households and people across the country can really expect to see interest rates rise and at least for the time being inflation to also be very very high raising interest rates is a tricky Balancing Act and often the bank of England is looking into the future to see what will be needed rather than responding directly to events on the day if the bank of England raises interest rates too quickly it's like slamming the brakes on the economy this could tip us backwards into a recession however if rates are raised too slowly inflation could pick up momentum and remain high for longer and become harder to Halt with the cost of goods becoming more unhinged from people's earnings still there's no denying interest rate can be a blunt instrument to keep inflation low those with large debts such as mortgages or loans will feel the impact acutely while those with cash to spare will benefit from higher interest rates on their savings this could increase wealth inequality in the UK people like you are waking up to the fact that borrowing is not going to be cheap forever interest rates are rising in almost every major economy from Norway to South Korea but if it's one thing history shows us is that periods of high inflation cause major political instability

LJS3xyTcU7k,2.0,0,[Music] you've read the headlines for months the u.s dealing with the highest inflation we've seen in decades the things you routinely bought a year ago costing you nearly 10 percent more today but why is that what's driving the current inflation rate and is there any clearer sign of where the economy is headed that's what we're breaking down in this case that explains the short answer is inflation is rising prices what's dragging on forever is the way it feels it's not a one-month flip in prices but a continual increase in prices cereal is 13 more expensive compared to last year eggs up nearly 11 just about everything costs more basically it's it's increases in in prices of the things that we tend to buy most often so what got us here answering that means we have to go back here to the moments in march of 2020 we won't forget we are now in a state of emergency on the national the state and city level here in san antonio tonight we're announcing our stay-at-home emergency declarations with everyone stuck at home cash flow across the country was down we weren't spending like we used to so the federal government tried to stimulate the economy by sending out stimulus checks to americans three rounds of checks between march of 2020 and march of 2021. each of those stimulus rounds also came with hundreds of dollars given per child it helped some people cover lost wages because of the pandemic or pay for things they couldn't afford otherwise then came the third round of stimulus money in march 2021 fourteen hundred dollar checks that time the stimulus package that came out of 1.9 trillion that congress passed was too big and how it was basically paid for was by printing money problem was was our economic output shortfall by the time they pass the 1.9 trillion was about half a trillion so we're short half a trillion but then you spend 1.9 trillion that's too big of spending think of the u.s economy like a fish tank the water represents money and during the pandemic the water or money got too low because nobody was spending so the government added more by sending out those checks but if you add too much water a tank will overflow and if you print too much money you get inflation cash flow is only part of this equation something else wasn't flowing because of the pandemic either stuff a lot of it's supply chain related the fact that the uh port of uh ports in particular the ports of los angeles and long beach where most of the containers come into the us 40 of the goods imported by the u.s come in through those two ports and with covid they've had trouble keeping staffing levels up keeping the goods flowing hard time getting chips for cars computers etc so there was more money in the economy but fewer things to spend it on so prices on what was available went up and then so did oil prices russia invaded ukraine in february 2022 that had an impact on the global oil market as countries trying to hit russia where it hurts because of u.s sanctions or i should say generally nato sanctions that there's a desire to to punish the russians for their invasion of ukraine it's not clear how effective some of those sanctions are what is clear is the combined punch to your paycheck the u.s inflation rate is at eight and a half percent right now according to the consumer price index that's a record kept by the government to show how prices on things you pay for are changing so crude oil or raw steel or commercial real estate none of those things are in the cpi but gasoline bananas your rent that you pay all those things are every month the consumer price index looks at 60 to 80 000 prices on a range of items from 75 different locations all across the country you know that gives us this big pile of prices and then we take that big pile of prices and sort of compare it to the previous pilot prices and see how much they've gone up take a gallon of whole milk the consumer price index says we were paying around three dollars 25 cents for that in july 2020 363 in july 2021 and 4 15 this july the consumer price index is published monthly but it's not just used to help you understand what's costing more it's also a factor in business decisions maybe landlords or who are using it to raise their rent or bosses who are using it to give their employees raises or people in the financial world who are interested in what's happening with inflation and social security recipients get a cost of living adjustment every year based on the cpi but the current inflation rate is one the u.s hasn't seen in 40 years so that's the problem and the federal reserve has taken steps to try to fix it by raising interest rates this summer the fed has done it twice each time raising it by three quarters of a percent now to a range of 2.25 to two and a half percent it's an effort to try to discourage people from borrowing and spending money the belief is that the economy is running too hot that there's too much demand and we need to sort of quell that demand and rising interest rates will do that but it could take a while to see progress it's not like instantaneously when the federal reserve raises interest rates immediately the economy slows down it's like driving a super tanker right it takes time to make a turn to the left or the right it'll happen or just happen with the delay the bigger question may not be when but if if the u.s economy will avoid recession the track record of trying to avoid recessions by the federal reserve when they're trying to reduce inflation is not good the so-called soft landing where you reduce inflation without causing a recession is a rare event it's often a hard landing where you get a recession the odds are soon we will be in a recession but san antonio may have something working in its favor a local economy that's not what it used to be all that to say that san antonio its economy uh is much more than military city usa or you know a tourism destination san antonio is much more than that now there's aerospace there's uh healthcare medical a whole host of financial services a whole host of other industries that sort of uh uh buffer the economy you can buffer the economy somewhat in a recession [Applause] and then just last week the head of the federal reserve said it is likely we'll see another increase in interest rates this year as the fed keeps

zcIjkN9wM0U,3.0,0,the abs have just released inflation figures or more accurately they've released their preferred measure of inflation which is the consumer price index or the cpi and the cpi basically measures all the goods that an average household buys there are tens of thousands of goods and they're weighted depending on how the average household buys them so if the average household spent fifteen percent on groceries then groceries would make up fifteen percent of the cpi if they spent thirty percent on accommodation like rent then rent would make up 30 of the cpi and basically every quarter the abs measures how these prices have increased and mash it together to give us the average increase in prices for the average household now these figures were particularly high this quarter in fact the inflation rate increased at 5.1 which is the fastest rate it's increased since the introduction of the gst so the consumer price index increased by 5.1 over the last year and this is far faster than how fast wages are increasing wages have only increased by 2.3 percent over the last 12 months this means that the amount of stuff that the average household can buy is going down that is the kinds of things they're buying are going up in price faster than their incomes are increasing economists call this the real wage and at the moment real wages are going down now while the average increase in prices is 5.1 percent the abs actually splits all of those goods and services into essential and non-essential goods now essential goods are the kinds of goods that you need to buy things like groceries accommodation electricity and power and they are increasing far faster than non-essential goods so while the average increase in prices is 5.1 the increase in essentials is 6.6 significantly higher than the average and this is important for low-income households low-income households spend a far larger proportion of their income on the essentials this means that the income of the inflation faced by low-income households is more like 6.6 percent rather than 5.1 percent now this big increase in inflation has caused a lot of speculation that the rba the reserve bank of australia is going to increase interest rates the reserve bank doesn't like inflation and the way that it tries to dampen down price increases is by increasing interest rates how does this work well basically about 37 percent of households have a mortgage now if the rba increases interest rates then all of those households have got to spend more money on interest payments which means they have less money to spend on everything else so the point of increasing interest rates is actually to make everybody poorer so they can't buy other stuff and if they're demanding less stuff then those prices can't increase as quickly because there's less demand for them this also creates more unemployment so if there's less demand for the stuff in the economy then they need less people to make it which means unemployment is likely to go up now this is quite interesting at the moment because in the we've got both parties running around saying that they want to increase employment but if the rba is putting up interest rates they're effectively saying they think that unemployment is too low this creates an interesting situation where we might have the government trying to decrease the unemployment rate and at the same time the rba is trying to increase the unemployment rate to dampen down demand and so that's effectively like driving the car with your foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time so the latest abs figures show inflation is rising faster than at any time in the last 20 years this means that particularly low-income households are really going to feel the pinch and it could also mean that the rba puts up interest rates which will hurt mortgage holders thanks for watching if you want more content please subscribe to our channel and hit that like button [Music] you,0.041,0.841,0.118,0.9911,0.11290322580645161,0.14516129032258066,0.016129032258064516,0.1935483870967742,0.16129032258064516,0.08064516129032258,0.04838709677419355,0.24193548387096775,0.9127561500448745,0.8350676378772113

NBC News,2.0,0,can bitcoin save you from inflation bitcoins fans love the idea of using cryptocurrency as a hedge against hyperinflation in fact the original white paper which serves as the founding document for the whole asset class specifically talks of a phase when no coins will be created and it will become inflation free but is this really possible can bitcoin truly abolish the cycles of hyperinflation in human history that seem money returned to the value of the paper they printed on in places as diverse as germany zimbabwe and russia will it protect you if the price of bread is paid in a wheelbarrow full of banknotes so far the evidence is contradictory on the one hand bitcoin's price has almost no correlation with the market-based measures of inflation expectations for instance while gold a known inflation hedge has a near perfect relationship with u.s bonds to track inflation bitcoin does not and while gold still buys the same amount of stuff as it did in the days of ancient rulers of babylon bitcoin has only been around for little over a decade on the other hand for the brief period that bitcoin has existed its purchasing power certainly has risen yes there were periods of spectacular crashes where its value measured in u.s dollars collapsed but over time those who held on to the cryptocurrency rather than actively trading it were able to buy more and more with it in 2013 one bitcoin bought about half a barrel of oil in 2017 it bought 300. last year you could get more than a thousand barrels for a single bitcoin now economists might warn that at a macro level that's deflationary and counterproductive for investment and growth but for those hoarding bitcoin it was obviously a great result the jury is still out on whether this will remain true in the long run but until now at least bitcoin has proven a great store of wealth even as it failed to purely hedge inflation i'm eddie van der waals this is decrypted for more content like this follow us on your favorite platforms,0.04,0.767,0.193,0.9964,0.043478260869565216,0.21739130434782608,0.0,0.15217391304347827,0.1956521739130435,0.0,0.06521739130434782,0.32608695652173914,0.7777211096092296,0.77882797731569
47WQ8n6KPJU,2.0,0,i'm sure you've come across a barrage of articles and news reports about inflation in the last couple of months ever wondered what lies beneath the headlines on growth or inflation numbers and the jargon associated with the two most important macroeconomic indicators then this ready reckoner is all you need the world is stumbling from one economic crisis to another one is caused by a pandemic and the other by a military invasion the impact of these events have been fully reflected in two key indicators growth and inflation so what do these words mean if such questions leave you scratching your head keep watching this video as we've put together 10 terms that are key to understand the economic turmoil prevailing in india and the world number one annualized inflation it's the percentage change in prices for a period compared to the same period of the previous year it's calculated by comparing the respective index numbers whether the consumer price index or the wholesale price index for the two periods india's inflation target along that of other countries is spelt out in these terms next up is core inflation which measures inflation after excluding items whose prices are volatile food and fuel for instance this measure of inflation is more stable than the headline number and is seen as an indicator of the underlying demand number three is depression a fallen gdp for multiple years is termed a depression a recession is commonly defined as at least two consecutive quarters of year-on-year contraction in gdp such as the one india experience in the second and third quarters of 2020 following a nationwide lockdown next we have the k-shaped recovery this is what economists say india is currently experiencing with different sections of the economy recovering at varying rates for instance the rich may have become richer following the pandemic as they could easily work from home meanwhile the poor may have been rendered unemployed by the pandemic depending on the nature of their jobs and then there's the v-shaped recovery and as the name suggests it represents a near instantaneous recovery from a rapid decline it was thought india's recovery from the pandemic would be v-shaped but instead it has been k-shaped moving on monetary policy report is a report the rbi is legally mandated to release every six months published in april and in late september or early october every year it gives details about the sources of inflation and inflation forecasts for the next 6 to 18 months now coming on to stagflation which is a combination of stagnation and inflation it refers to a period of low growth and high inflation a classic example of stagflation is the 1970s the world bank has drawn comparisons between the current situation and the 1970s citing the prolonged period of highly accommodative monetary policy in major advanced economies followed by persistent supply-side disturbances pushing inflation higher and now coming to shrink flation stringflation refers to the phenomenon of companies maintaining the price of their goods but reducing the quantity offered let's say a packet of chips continues to cost 20 rupees but now weighs 52 grams instead of 60 grams earlier companies do this to avoid raising their prices which maybe can demand further and lead to a loss of market share this usually occurs when rising input costs put pressure on companies margins next is liquidity surplus or deficit which indicates the level of money available in the banking system during an economic crisis central banks provide extra liquidity as the rbi and other central banks did during the pandemic however excess liquidity can lead to higher inflation as greater sums of money chase the same number of goods and finally you have terminal rate it's the level of policy rate consistent with stable inflation and full capacity utilization this level of policy rate is not fixed and can vary over time economists say the terminal repo rate for india may be six to six and a half percent currently suggesting a series of rate hikes in the coming months hope this video was helpful guys don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music],0.064,0.865,0.072,0.1911,0.07692307692307693,0.13675213675213677,0.017094017094017096,0.2564102564102564,0.08547008547008547,0.15384615384615385,0.05128205128205128,0.2222222222222222,0.9005626514506878,0.8263569289210315
dGAFh0dCeDE,2.0,0,so Vicki today marks one year since President Biden signed the inflation reduction act the controversial legislation has been praised by democrats for its investment in climate issues and criticized by Republicans for raising taxes but surveys suggests most Americans don't really know what all is in it lucky for us our Noah pransky is here to explain it hey Noah hey there so what isn't it the things in it you got climate Investments Health Care reforms corporate tax reforms on their own all of these are individually popular and as the legislation turns one today the president wants you to know who is responsible we've heard lots of debate about the inflation reduction act the most important investment that we've ever made in our energy security the biggest tax hike the history of our country but do you really know what's in it let's break it down the inflation reduction act also known as the IRA committed a half trillion dollars over the next 10 years toward clean energy and Health Care Investments we're talking about tax credits for electric vehicles for improving your home energy consumption and for companies that produce renewable energy also insulin price caps prescription drug reform and Affordable Care Act subsidies to pay for it the IRA also included increased IRS enforcement and a 15 corporate minimum tax the Congressional budget office found the bill would more than pay for itself and in the year since it was signed inflation has pretty much done what the president promised it would this bill will in fact reduce inflationary pressure on the economy we're back close once again to the fed's two percent inflation Target but economists have been skeptical about attributing any drop in our inflation rate to the inflation reduction act in fact not even President Biden appears to be making that claim anymore at a recent fundraiser he said quote I wish I hadn't called it the inflation reduction act because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing Alternatives that generate economic growth wind energy is cheaper than fossil fuels salt orange is cheaper regardless only one in four Americans say today that they have a good idea of what's in the bill and Yale researchers found that only 38 of America approves of it however when that same group of respondents was briefed on the contents of the bill their support nearly doubled to 68 the provisions are popular in the rare cases where Americans are actually familiar with them which may explain the president's recent interest in barnstorming the country folks every Republican voted against our clean energy investment known as inflation reduction eager to talk all things IRA I mean let's talk about branding honestly at the end of the day the name of it didn't work Biden doesn't even like the name of it now but and you've mentioned that really interesting survey that found what 68 of people approved of what was actually in once they learned what's in it right well what about lawmakers this is crazy to me the reaction across party lines did people not know what they were voting for uh well I think lawmakers had an idea but again branding right so it's part of the Republican brand to oppose anything that the Biden Administration does it's part of their Democratic brand but nobody's really selling what's in it and just to prove your point uh this Yale study which showed huge shifts in favorability they mentioned the word investment and not spending that's where we saw the popularity almost double so again depending what you call it spending investment makes a big difference absolutely words matter words matter energy interesting as always thank you for breaking that down thanks for watching our YouTube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the NBC News app,0.027,0.776,0.197,0.9991,0.05194805194805195,0.1038961038961039,0.0,0.15584415584415584,0.18181818181818182,0.06493506493506493,0.07792207792207792,0.36363636363636365,0.8333103524661059,0.7866419294990723
dgmDcK5wssU,2.0,0,[Music] consumer prices are up interest rates are rising after about a generation global inflation is surging again why have millions of people around the world become exposed to high inflation and what can we do to bring it back under control henry i'm going to start with you what is inflation inflation is a rise in prices uh it's a rise in average prices measured by a basket of goods and services typically it's when everything gets expensive and when you think about that it's important to realize it's not when just one thing gets more expensive that's what we call a change in relative prices it's a change in overall prices why do economists get so exercised about it what happens if we just let inflation kind of do its thing why do we care so if inflation starts creeping up and i think that that's going to last then i might start pushing up you know the wage increase that i would like or the um prices that i would like to set and so what you have what you end up having is a situation where prices start creeping up higher and higher and higher and we know from places where inflation is really high that that has a cost my own view is that it's really more like an on off switch either inflation is low enough that people don't really have to worry about it too much or it's high enough that they pay a lot of attention because they're feeling it every time they buy anything and they have to budget more carefully and all the things that are going on right now and then it really shoots up the scales in terms of its political importance what are the levers that policymakers have to make inflation go up or down well there's been a consensus for about three decades or so that the primary responsibility for controlling inflation is the responsibility of the central bank and that the way in which you control inflation is by raising interest rates when inflation's too high which reduces the amount of spending in the economy reduces the amount of money chasing a limited pool of goods and services which is ultimately what causes people to put their prices up at the moment with inflation too high the real question is how high are central banks going to raise interest rates in order to fight it the next section we're going to is what we're going to do about inflation now um obviously at the moment central banks are raising rates pretty rapidly is this going to cause inflation to come down fairly quickly as the central banks hope i mean that's the question of the day really is how effective central banks are going to be in bringing down inflation the pace of the monetary tightening is pretty steep it's the steepest in america since the early 1980s um so after a period of hesitation it looks like they're taking the problem seriously um the real question now is how much pain that's going to cause i think there's a sort of dirty little secret of monetary economics and that's that the actual mechanisms by which higher interest rates flow through the economy aren't that well understood it wouldn't surprise me if they still have to go significantly higher but i have complete faith in the ability of higher interest rates to bring down inflation ultimately because if you raise rates high enough it will it will as ratchet said cause a cause a recession eventually and that's very effective at bringing inflation down if you're a policy maker now like what else are you or should you be thinking about doing to get inflation expectations down to the extent that inflation is about the balance between demand and supply in the economy you know other policies that reduce aggregate demand would bring inflation down as well and their you know tighter fiscal policy raising taxes reducing spending would bring down prices as well what we're being reminded of right now is just how unpopular inflation is how much people dislike um you know prices pump going up um the feeling that when they go to supermarkets they can afford less and less you know and and that has political consequences and can drive politicians and governments to try to do things to rein in price rises the proof is in the pudding central banks have to deliver the low inflation and then people will believe that inflation is going to be low thanks for watching to read the economist coverage of inflation click on the link and don't forget to subscribe,0.043,0.874,0.082,0.9814,0.072,0.176,0.048,0.288,0.096,0.072,0.04,0.208,0.8989045112953852,0.8193280000000001

bF7whqPOhmk,3.0,0,[Music] inflation is a decrease in the purchasing power of money which is reflected in a general increase in the prices of goods and services in the country's economy in 1980 for example a movie ticket cost on average 2.89 by 2020 the average price of a movie ticket had risen to 10.16 with 10 you could have watched four movies in the 1980s but with that same amount of money you can only watch one movie now this decrease in movie ticket purchasing power of the us dollar is considered inflation however don't think about inflation in terms of an increase in pricing for a single item inflation refers to the broad increase in prices across a sector or an industry like the automotive food and beverages or energy business and ultimately a country's entire economy,0.0,0.903,0.097,0.9091,0.08333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.20833333333333334,0.16666666666666666,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.25,0.8738845074797779,0.8229166666666666

UbAKuCp8y98,2.0,0,on this vote the yeas are 220 the nays are 207 the resolution the motion is adopted [Applause] the inflation reduction act officially passed in congress today the sweeping tax climate and health bill will land on president biden's desk next week and not a single republican voted for it back with us tonight to discuss all of it california congresswoman katie porter katie i heard you might even have a white board with you which is really your signature move and i'm excited about it inflation reduction act great name now for all of those who say president biden what are you going to do about inflation you've got it explain to us how it's going to help the american people well the thrust of the bill is bringing down costs and for american families in the short term through things like reducing the health care premiums that families pay within the affordable care act reducing the price of prescription drugs and reducing energy costs for families in terms of heating and cooling their homes so those are the three areas that families are going to see immediate investments but the other part about this is about creating a kind of strong stable globally competitive economy that's going to have the kind of energy independence and energy security that will help us fight forces like global instability that can lead to inflation in the future so i think there's this is a a terrific economic plan and then it both addresses short-term um concerns where are american families right now but also as a mom as someone who's thinking about the future this sets us up to equal and best our global competitors in terms of the economy of tomorrow there are some republicans out there warning with the passage of this bill there will be quote an army of 87 000 irs agents coming for americans earning less than 75 000 a year you want a fact check what what a load of malarkey that is just not true let me tell you the straight deal i get phone calls every day from my constituents and my colleagues around the country i'm asking for help with federal agencies that are not being responsive that they're waiting on answers from the number one agency that the american people would like to have have more agents be more helpful pick up the phone build better technology be more responsive is the irs so this is an investment in allowing the irs to modernize and prepare for the wave of anticipated retirements in customer service agents that we're already facing the audit piece of this is focused on big corporations and that's exactly why you're hearing republicans who are beholden to those big corporations try to weaken and attack this piece the reality is the focus of the bill on the audit piece is on big corporations it's on cracking down on corporate tax cheats and here's how that math works for every dollar that we invest in irs enforcement of the most wealthy americans and the largest corporations with an army of lawyers and accountants to do their bidding we can recover five dollars in taxes that are owed to the rest of us and ultimately this kind of investment is going to let us have a more stable tax structure going forward could you have that white board you can wipe it off because i want you to fill it out for me again the next time you're here and explain to me how come private equity firms are still allowed to cheat this system but we will save that for another day i want to take the time i have left to ask you what this bill is going to do to address climate change absolutely this bill makes a historically important investment in green energy and what this is going to do is allow the american economy to best our competitors at winning the green manufacturing jobs of the future the country that is able to dominate on the world stage for the next 10 50 years is going to be the country that figures out how to do that in a way that is not dependent on fossil fuel prices not dependent on petrol dictators not creating pollution that has to be cleaned up it's the company it's the country that's going to do it in a green way and so this makes a 50 billion dollar investment in technologies like wind and solar that are going to help us do that manufacturing without the cost and the burden of the pollution that we've seen in some traditional manufacturing so for me this is about creating good high paying jobs and creating the foundation for more high-paying jobs in the future all right then congressman katie porter always good to see you especially when you are celebrating on a friday night thanks for coming thank you [Music] you,0.04,0.807,0.153,0.9985,0.03875968992248062,0.20930232558139536,0.046511627906976744,0.08527131782945736,0.17054263565891473,0.05426356589147287,0.06976744186046512,0.32558139534883723,0.8737146079413427,0.8023556276666066

WGAGNKHVJ-c,2.0,0,[Music] if your current expenses are around 60 000 rupees a month at the current rate of inflation 10 years from now you would need around 1.44 lakh rupees to buy the same things that's nearly double the same amount of money applying the same logic to your savings if you're saving ten thousand rupees today how much would it be worth ten years down the line going by the current inflation rate of seven percent or thereabouts it will fetch your goods and services worth only 5083 rupees that means the value of today's 10 000 rupees will decline significantly and your purchasing power will only go down in the times to come i'm not trying to scare you i am simply decoding what the latest cpi numbers mean for you and i cpi or consumer price index is hovering around 8-year highs of above 7 and has consistently been coming above rbi's tolerance band of 2-6 for over six months now from your groceries to even your kids education everything has become expensive by over seven percent in the past one year and this is not all you might see further price rise in future if the central bank fails to arrest this high inflation rate now you may not be able to control this phenomenon of rising prices but what you can do is create a diversified portfolio a portfolio that will help you beat inflation in the long term so that you don't have to worry about what's happening in the short term in this video we tell you how to rethink your financial plans and how to budget for inflation but first do subscribe to money control's youtube channel and don't forget to like this video now financial planners say it's important to take into account how prices of different items will rise going forward the general advice is to plan for higher costs of health care services and education expenses but lifestyle expenses also go up as income levels and aspirations go up and so do groceries and travel expenses so you must budget for all that but how do you ensure that your financial goals are met keeping in mind the rising expenses here are three tips from experts one try to invest more than you think you can two be conservative when it comes to projecting returns in your financial plan and number three start investing in your early years now the question is which are the best investment vehicles amid rising inflation real estate well that's a popular choice to invest in in times of high inflation it generates increased rental income investors can either buy real estate directly or invest in a specialized fund commodities when inflation picks up investors often turn to tangible assets that rise in value gold has been a safe haven for investors amid high inflation investors can look to put their money in etfs or mutual funds that own gold number three inflation index bonds inflation index bonds give returns that are more than the rate of inflation therefore the price rise does not erode the value of investors savings stocks are also known to be potential inflation hedges the market price of value stocks is usually directly proportional to the rate of inflation therefore when inflation rate rises value stocks tend to perform better so that's that you cannot control inflation but you can definitely control your finances start planning now for a better future for more such updates subscribe to the money control channel and stay tuned to the space for more updates [Music],0.01,0.871,0.119,0.9965,0.05952380952380952,0.23809523809523808,0.0,0.21428571428571427,0.15476190476190477,0.05952380952380952,0.05952380952380952,0.21428571428571427,0.862953030970638,0.8168934240362812
fyWrbUcCPr0,1.0,0,[Music] you can afford anything you just can't afford everything every choice that you make is a trade-off against something else and that doesn't just apply to your money that applies to your time your focus your energy your attention to any limited resource that you need to manage saying yes to something implicitly means turning away all other opportunities and that opens up two critical questions first what matters most not what does society say ought to matter most but what is truly a priority a value in your life that's the first question and the second question is how do you put that into action how do you make decisions that reflect that which matters most answering these two questions is a lifetime practice and that's what this podcast is here to explore and facilitate my name is paula pant i'm the host of the afford anything podcast and in today's episode we're going to take a deep dive into understanding inflation it's a hot topic it's been on everyone's mind it's the subject of news reports headlines cocktail party conversation what is inflation today's episode will be an explainer episode to peel back the layers of the onion and understand what this concept truly is now we're gonna do that for the first two thirds of the show and then the final one third of the show we're going to close out with something completely different in the final one third of the show i will be playing a speech that i made at the economy conference which is a conference that draws a lot of people who are chasing financial independence so that's what's in store for the final third of the show but for the first two thirds of the show let's understand inflation first a few disclaimers before we get started number one we are not trying to predict the future we are simply trying to make sense of the present so this discussion about inflation is educational not predictive and nothing i say is meant to be taken as a device only as background for educational and entertainment purposes number two i am not an econ professor nor do i play one on tv i trained as a journalist many years ago and today i'm a finance podcaster which is a polite way of saying i'm a person with access to the internet so take that for what it's worth now with those two disclaimers out of the way let's get started and we're going to break this discussion into five parts part one what is inflation what's the cause of inflation part two what are the effects of inflation and how are different types of assets impacted part three how is inflation measured part four historic examples and part five the relationship between inflation and unemployment all right let's get started part one what is inflation and what causes it there are some who define inflation as too much money chasing too few goods that's a cute description certainly a sticky one but it is a description that overly emphasizes the demand side of the causes of inflation so rather than describe it as too much money chasing too few goods the more technical description is that inflation is what takes place when the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy and this results in a decline in purchasing power for a given currency in other words goods and services cost more than they used to so if the cause of inflation is that the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy that presents an obvious follow-up question which is how does the money supply grow there are three common ways that it can happen number one the money supply can grow from the printing and issuance of new money number two the money supply can grow when a government decides to loan a new money into the banking system by purchasing government bonds and number three the money supply can grow if a government decides to legally devalue the currency now in addition to those three ways that the money supply can grow printing money loaning money and legally devaluing the currency the other element of inflation is not just the supply of money but the velocity of money so the supply of money is what we just discussed new money gets pumped into the system through one or a combination of the three mechanisms that we just described but the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands the speed of transaction if a bunch of money is pumped into the system but everyone hides it under their mattress this doesn't create the same type of inflationary pressure as new money getting pumped into the system and then buyers and sellers exchanging that money for goods and services at high velocity the supply of money is the attribute that a government can directly control the velocity of money however can only indirectly be influenced through the mechanisms that create or detract from consumer confidence and investor confidence so how does that confidence the willingness of consumers to spend how does that contribute to inflation in order to answer that question we first must take a step back and ask ourselves how exactly is it that both the money supply and the velocity of money have an impact in inflation what is the mechanism through which that takes place the answer to that question is that there are three common mechanisms one takes place when demand outpaces supply the growth in money supply leads to consumer confidence in other words people have more money so they want to spend it but production capabilities can't match that demand when that happens when demand outpaces supply we wind up in a situation where we have too much money chasing too few goods resulting in higher prices however that is only one of three mechanisms the second mechanism takes place when manufacturers suppliers retailers when they face higher production costs this happens when there's some disruption that makes the cost of raw materials or the cost of production rise and that has a downstream effect on the retail costs of goods and services so for example the cost of copper the cost of lumber the cost of steel if there is some disruption either to the acquisition of raw materials or to the processing the transportation the production capabilities or supply chain capabilities if there are any upstream disruptions then the producers in the middle face longer wait times and higher costs and this gets passed down to the end consumer that's the second mechanism and then the third mechanism is what's known as the wage price spiral this takes place when prices begin to rise which means life gets more expensive as a result workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising prices businesses raise wages and raise salaries in order to meet that worker demand and in order to attract and retain talent and businesses then have to raise the price of their own goods and services in order to pay their higher labor costs this creates a self-reinforcing spiral known as the wage price spiral so that's the third mechanism now if much of what i've talked about sounds familiar it's because this is the story that we have all lived over the last two years on the demand side when we went into shutdowns in 2020 services like concerts massages haircuts those services were no longer available and so consumers turned their demand away from services and towards goods in addition stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits grew the money supply and kept consumer confidence strong further fueling this demand for goods but the production capabilities and the supply chain capabilities for producers to produce those goods could not meet this added demand in addition to that in many sectors in order for producers to be able to increase their production capacity they either need to make very large capital expenditure investments that require a long lead time as is the case with lumber lumber milling or producers didn't have the confidence that this demand would persist after the shutdowns ended and so for certain items producers felt it too risky to invest in enhanced capex if that means that they might end up in a situation two years in the future where they are over producing once this temporary boost in demand subsides now on top of all of that we've talked about the wage price spiral but fueling that wage price spiral was a labor shortage as more people opted out of the workforce either because they need to homeschool their children they need to care for an ill or elderly family member or they received enough in various forms of non-wage payment that they could afford to opt out of the workforce and so the labor shortage amplified the wage price spiral and so you can see what's happened in the last two years is that when we talk about these three mechanisms that fuel inflation one being demand outpaces supply two being higher production costs and three being the wage price spiral there have been other inflationary periods where one or two of those factors have driven inflation but in the last two years we have experienced pronounced effects in all three and so this wraps up part one of the five key parts of this episode part one being where we address the question what is inflation and what causes it and to recap the highlights inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services and a decrease in the purchasing power of a given currency and it happens when the growth in money supply outpaces the growth in the economy the money supply grows through the printing and issuance of new money through the loaning of new money into the system and through legally devaluing the currency the money supply however is just one of two factors that influence inflation the other being the velocity of money so the supply of money and the velocity of money both play a role and they play a role through three mechanisms demand outpaces supply higher production costs and the wage price spiral so that's the recap of part one all right let's move to part two what are the effects of inflation part one we discussed cause part two we're discussing effect and let's start with the good news some degree of inflation is desirable inflation spurs investment because investors look to various assets like equities commodities real estate in order to beat inflation inflation also spurs spending because the knowledge that cash tomorrow will be worth less than cash today is a motivator to spend now so it's healthy for a society to have a small controlled degree of inflation times in developed economies like the united states a target inflation rate of around two percent is considered just the right dose in more rapidly developing economies that inflation rate can notch up a bit higher india has set its target inflation rate at four percent with a plus minus two percent on either end so they've set a target range of between two to six percent so different nations set different inflation targets because inflation does produce some healthy benefits into the system but even in the best of times inflation needs to be managed carefully and every time a government introduces new money into a financial system the first order effect is felt based on how where and when that new money is issued and this leads to a discussion around something called the cantelon effect quick pronunciation note some people call it the cantillon effect others pronounce it the cantelon effect i'll be calling it cantelon it was named for an economist who lived in the 18th century named richard cantelon he observed that when new money enters into a system when the money supply grows it does not have an immediate universal effect on all prices in all industries impacting all people instead it has a localized effect and the closer you are to that injection of liquidity the faster you will feel that effect so the cantalon effect states that prices and inflation will rise at different rates for different market sectors which is a concept known as relative inflation now what this means is that those who are closest to the source of that money the source of the new liquidity that's entering the system will enjoy a higher quality of life and will have the opportunity to generate the largest amount of wealth as a result of their proximity to this liquidity that's entering the system stated simply when new money enters a system the people or companies who can get their hands on it first can take advantage of this new money and make investments and allow this money to compound and grow and they can do that before this injection of new money into the financial system has time to spread across the entire system in other words they can make investments before inflation becomes obvious everywhere and that's why decisions around how where and when new money enters the system is so critically important think back to the beginning of the pandemic when individuals and households were receiving stimulus checks remember that first stimulus check it was a huge input of new money into the system and when those stimulus checks came out a lot of individual investors opened up accounts on robinhood and started investing their stimis the cultural phenomenon of meme stocks and stonks the reddit run-up of gamestop and amc theaters all of that happened when new money entered into the financial system but inflation hadn't kicked in yet and so those who received that new money were able to invest it or use it to speculate now oftentimes banks or financial institutions are the recipients of the new money supply because as we discussed earlier one way that the money supply grows is by loaning new money into the banking system by purchasing bonds once the banking system has money they're able to lend it out both to businesses such as small businesses looking for loans and to consumers such as retail home buyers and the people in companies who were able to get those loans are poised to benefit significantly as inflation picks up because inflation is good for borrowers particularly good for borrowers with fixed rate loans because when you borrow money and you have a fixed interest rate and that rate is less than the rate of inflation then over time you repay that loan with cheaper and cheaper dollars so inflation is great for borrowers this is a wonderful time to have a fixed rate mortgage or a few of them if you're a rental property investor but it's bad for savers because savings are eroded inflation is good for exporters because exporters can produce something while paying the production costs associated with a weaker us dollar they can then sell that item overseas and collect payment in a stronger currency and they can benefit from that enhanced spread so inflation is good for exporters but it's bad for importers because a weaker us dollar means that foreign-made goods are more expensive another way in the u.s every dollar becomes less valuable and so what does that mean for assets how are different types of assets impacted well tangible assets that are valued in currency like real estate gold commodities these are inflation hedges and particularly if you have a tangible asset like real estate and a fixed rate loan as a borrower who has borrowed money in order to acquire that tangible asset you now have a fantastic setup in an inflationary environment not only do you own a tangible asset you also are a borrower in a period of high inflation so it's a double win now in contrast to tangible assets paper assets assets that are denominated in currency like cash or bonds these types of assets are eroded by inflation so in an inflationary environment tangible assets good paper assets bad borrowing money good saving money i don't want to say bad saving money is a value that i espouse but yeah inflation is bad for savers broadly speaking stocks and real estate have historically been great hedges against inflation but not all stocks are created equal growth stocks in particular are negatively affected now what do i mean when i say growth stocks let's pause let's take a step back we'll zoom out stocks equities generally are classified based on size style and location so when i say size i'm talking large cap mid cap small cap when i say location i'm talking u.s international emerging markets frontier markets and when i say style i'm talking about growth stocks value stocks or a blend those are three common classifications for equities now let's take a close-up look at the style classification growth stocks are stocks that seem to be very promising for the future so they may not necessarily be turning a profit right now their numbers today might not look that great but their future prospects seem optimistic enough that investors are willing to make a bet that these stocks these growth stocks will outperform the market over time this is in contrast to the alternate style value stocks which are stocks that typically tend to be performing well today but the investors decide are trading at a cost that is less than what they're actually worth in other words with value stocks investors believe that the market has undervalued the worth of a given company the market has underpriced that company and so value stocks are sought after based on their current performance and their current price relative to their current performance by contrast growth stocks are sought after based on the expectation of their future performance and this is where inflation starts to fiddle with those numbers because when dollars become less valuable the present value of those future dollars is also reduced and as a result growth stocks tend to take a hit in an inflationary environment now tech stocks tend to represent a lot of growth stocks and the tech sector also represents the biggest stocks talk large cap the biggest stocks in the index so among the 10 biggest stocks in the s p 500 we find apple microsoft amazon facebook google tesla and nvidia all of which are tech stocks all of which are among the 10 biggest stocks in the overall s p 500 now just because they're tech stocks doesn't mean they're necessarily considered growth stocks that's disclaimer number one that i want to make disclaimer number two that i want to make is that sometimes a growth investor and a value investor might both buy the same stock for different reasons philip fisher is one of the most acclaimed american investors of the 20th century he is sometimes referred to as the father of growth investing and ironically his son is a value investor and he wrote about times when both he and his son would purchase exactly the same stock but philip fisher would come to that decision through a decision-making framework that prioritized growth stocks and his son would come to that same decision through a decision-making framework that prioritized value investing so that's the second disclaimer that i want to throw out there not all tech stocks are growth stocks and some growth stocks are also really good value stock picks with that said it is also the case that there's a lot of overlap between growth stocks and tech stocks and it is also the case that the broad market is heavily represented by large cap tech stocks and so some of the volatility the swings that we're seeing in the market right now and the declines that some major companies have faced in the past few weeks much of that reflects investors repricing these stocks and reassessing what they're willing to pay for the prospect of future returns in light of the high inflationary environment that we're currently in so stocks and real estate historically are great hedges against inflation but not all stocks are created equal and there will be in the short term volatility in the markets as investors reassess what they believe companies are worth in light of inflation expectations and by the way i don't mean to constantly be banging the pro real estate drum but if you've spent the last couple of years sitting on the sidelines considering possibly investing in real estate the draw of locking in a fixed rate mortgage and buying a tangible asset that historically is a low volatility inflation hedge that tangible asset of course being real estate that draw the inflation protection that real estate can provide is particularly appealing at this point in time we know that inflation is not transitory it's here to stay and the current economic environment really highlights the usefulness of holding a tangible asset like real estate that provides a stable long-term inflation hedge if you want to learn more about real estate go to affordance dot com slash vip list that's afford anything dot com slash vip list we'll email you a ton of information about real estate it's totally free lots of valuable information contained there around how to approach this asset class afford anything dot com slash vip list so let's recap what we've talked about in part one we defined what is inflation we discussed the causes of inflation and we related this to everything that's transpired in the last two years in part two we discussed the effects of inflation we talked about how some degree of inflation is desirable a target of around two percent for a developed nation like the us and that even in the best of times inflation needs to be managed carefully because anytime you inject liquidity into a financial system the effect is not felt equally we discussed the cantillin effect which describes the concept of relative inflation which means there's a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy that takes place at different times and the closer a person or entity is to the source of that liquidity the faster they're likely to be to access that money and therefore generate wealth so the cantillon effect describes how the new money supply has localized effects we talked about how inflation is bad for some people and good for others for example it's bad for savers and good for borrowers bad for importers good for exporters we talked about the difference between tangible assets versus paper assets and we described growth versus value stocks part three of this five part deep dive understanding inflation at a conceptual level remember as we discussed in part two inflation doesn't happen universally across all sectors of the economy at the same time and so in order to measure inflation we have to track a diversified basket of goods and services there are two such baskets that are used in the u.s one is the cpi the other is the ppi the cpi the consumer price index is a weighted basket of consumer needs so it represents things like transportation food medical care the types of necessities and consumer staples that individuals and households have to buy which is another way of saying the cpi measures or at least attempts to measure cost of living so when the cpi is calculated retail prices are tracked meaning they're not looking at production costs they're not looking at wholesale costs they're looking purely at what you or i would pay for an item on the open market and then those changes in price are weighted in proportion to the significance of that good or service when it comes to household spending so all these retail prices are being tracked in accordance with their relative weight within this basket but here's the thing sometimes there are items in this basket that change in price for reasons that don't have anything to do with inflation and sometimes those items constitute such a big chunk of household spending that including those items in there can really throw the numbers off specifically i'm talking about food and fuel sometimes food prices go up because there was a hurricane or there's some sort of e coli outbreak or as happened recently a safety inspector got a credible death threat and now we have a shortage of avocados coming in from mexico which is causing the price of guacamole to go up these types of events particularly natural disasters weather events these can temporarily impact the price of food or the price of certain types of food but it doesn't reflect anything related to inflation and similarly the cost of fuel oil and gas that can be impacted by a whole bunch of factors including political factors that don't necessarily reflect inflation so both of those sectors food and fuel are pretty volatile if those two sectors move that can have an outsized impact on cpi even though it doesn't actually reflect inflationary pressures and so there's a measure a different measure referred to as core inflation and core inflation is the measure of cpi minus food and fuel core inflation looks at price changes across that same diversified basket of services goods and services except for food and energy in order to mitigate the impact of these volatile sectors is it a better way to measure inflation that's a subject of debate but certainly it provides another data point that can round out the picture and another data point that can round out the picture is what's known as the ppi the producer price index and this measures the average weighted price changes that sellers receive for intermediate goods to state it simply the cpi is looking at inflation from the perspective of retail buyers you and me the ppi is looking at inflation from the perspective of sellers and producers if you go to the bureau of labor statistics website you'll see that the ppi publishes more than 3 700 commodity price indexes for goods and 800 for seasonally adjusted services so they're tracking a lot of the price changes that are happening upstream and that offers another layer of insight that can round out the way that we monitor and measure inflation now we don't hear about ppi as much on the news typically we'll hear some headline related to the cpi and often the discussion is really around two things number one how much has it gone up but number two how fast is it continuing to go up have we hit an apex after which the rate of increase will slow or are we a boulder rolling down a hill with lots of momentum and no sign of stopping anytime you're monitoring any metric or any change you're looking not just at the month over month numbers but also at the increase or decrease within those numbers over time and again this episode is not here to predict the future this episode is here to have a stronger understanding of the present and so to that end bear in mind that whenever you see a headline about cpi look not just at the most recent reported change but also at how that change compares contextually to the rate at which it's been changing and that wraps up part three our discussion on how inflation is measured leading us to part four let's talk about some historic examples how has inflation played out in the past we'll start in the 1920s with the german weimar republic germany financed world war one by borrowing heavily and printing huge amounts of unbacked currency fiat currency and the reason i'm taking the time to note that it was unbacked was because prior to world war one germany's currency was backed by gold germany got rid of this gold standard in 1914 and at the time the german mark the french franc the italian lira and the british shilling all had roughly equal value and roughly comparable dollar exchange rates us dollar exchange rates so that was the situation in 1914 but then from 1914 to 1919 prices of everything in germany doubled as germany both borrowed a lot of money and printed a lot of money to be able to pay for the war world war one ended in 1918 and under the treaty of versailles it was required to make reparations payments in gold-backed marks this created a degree of financial stress and remember how we mentioned that prices doubled between 1914 and 1919 well they doubled again between 1919 and 1922. and so by 1922 many citizens were starting to get rid of their paper assets get rid of their currency and convert it into tangible assets pianos diamonds pieces of art real estate people began piling into tangible goods because prices had doubled twice in the last eight years but despite this people were more worried about unemployment than they were about inflation the chief objective was to keep the population working and germany saw that given the devaluation of the mark they were well poised to be able to export many of their goods so they just kept printing money they kept printing money in order to facilitate exports and keep the population employed and what happened next was it spiraled out of control in 1914 one u.s dollar was worth about four or five german marks by november 1923 one us dollar was equal to one trillion marks so at that point the currency straight up lost all meaning and ordinary citizens were bartering goods with one another they were that into tangible assets that by 1923 people were trading a handkerchief for some carrots or a shirt for some shoes people were also especially pre-1923 when it really went to rail back in 1921 before it spiraled out of control people were also aggressively investing in foreign currencies trading german marks for a litany of currencies from many other nations as a side note i will make the connection that cryptocurrencies which are non-fiat currencies grew in popularity during the pandemic and as i've said many times before on this podcast when we talk about quote unquote investing in crypto what we're really talking about is a form of currency exchange in which you exchange one medium of exchange the us dollar for a different medium of exchange such as bitcoin or ethereum or stellar lumens now i'm not stating that the us is going to be the weimar republic absolutely not but i do think there's a notable parallel that when a population anticipates inflation one of the things that ordinary individuals do is they start converting their money into other forms of currency and it happens that we currently live in an age where currency can be digital and programming language can be written such that the issuance of new supply of that digital currency into circulation is governed by an algorithm rather than by politicians again i am not comparing the us to the weimar republic in any way whatsoever please don't think i'm doing that and and what i'm largely speaking to is the reframing of cryptocurrency not as an investment but as an alternate currency at any rate this is a history lesson so we won't go down the crypto rabbit hole but that is the cautionary tale of the weimar republic and it's a tale of hyperinflation and while it's easy to say well that was the 1920s that happened in literally a century ago and that was a very different time there was a war in europe there was a different pandemic the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and that was a much deadlier pandemic one third of the world's population ended up infected by the virus and about 50 million people worldwide died in that pandemic so they were dealing with a lot back then nothing that we could ever relate to so why spend all this time talking about something that happened a century ago why live in the past and if that's what you're thinking all right fair enough let's talk about zimbabwe zimbabwe was the first nation to experience hyperinflation in the 21st century in 2007 as the rest of the world was undergoing the great recession zimbabwe's inflation rate topped 50 per month and it got worse from there by november 2008 prices were doubling on average every 24 hours but i don't want to sound alarmist or i don't want to sound as though i'm telling you about these historic examples in order to create an alarmist narrative because the reality is nothing like that has ever happened in the united states in 2007 2008 when zimbabwe was experiencing hyperinflation we in the u.s were experiencing what's known as biflation biflation is an example of the cantillon effect and it happens when there's strong demand for certain types of assets and weak demand for others causing prices in one sector of the economy to rise and prices in other sectors to fall which means that we simultaneously experience both inflation and deflation at the same time that's biflation that's what happened in the u.s during the great recession of 2007-2008 given the severity of the 2008 recession and given the amount of money that was pumped into the economy in order to get us out of that recession it is truly uplifting and very fortuitous that inflation fears that some of us held during that time did not come to pass we ended that recession and launched into a decade of prosperity with a low inflation rate an 11-year bull run and an unprecedented flourishing of digital innovation that took place over the last decade and so fortunately our most recent example of inflation or specifically biflation fortunately is not a cautionary tale it did not spiral out of control in fact the worst that the u.s has experienced was a two-decade period from the mid-1960s,0.043,0.845,0.113,0.9999,0.13123092573753814,0.17497456765005087,0.017293997965412006,0.15768056968463887,0.1363173957273652,0.03560528992878942,0.10478128179043744,0.24211597151576805,0.9152054096555071,0.8375506706585711
