generation global inflation is surging again why have millions of people around the world become exposed to high inflation and what can we do to bring it back under control henry i'm going to start with you what is inflation inflation is a rise in prices uh it's a rise in average prices measured by a basket of goods and services typically it's when everything gets expensive and when you think about that it's important to realize it's not when just one thing gets more expensive that's what we call a change in relative prices it's a change in overall prices why do economists get so exercised about it what happens if we just let inflation kind of do its thing why do we care so if inflation starts creeping up and i think that that's going to last then i might start pushing up you know the wage increase that i would like or the um prices that i would like to set and so what you have what you end up having is a situation where prices start creeping up higher and higher and higher and we know from places where inflation is really high that that has a cost my own view is that it's really more like an on off switch either inflation is low enough that people don't really have to worry about it too much or it's high enough that they pay a lot of attention because they're feeling it every time they buy anything and they have to budget more carefully and all the things that are going on right now and then it really shoots up the scales in terms of its political importance what are the levers that policymakers have to make inflation go up or down well there's been a consensus for about three decades or so that the primary responsibility for controlling inflation is the responsibility of the central bank and that the way in which you control inflation is by raising interest rates when inflation's too high which reduces the amount of spending in the economy reduces the amount of money chasing a limited pool of goods and services which is ultimately what causes people to put their prices up at the moment with inflation too high the real question is how high are central banks going to raise interest rates in order to fight it the next section we're going to is what we're going to do about inflation now um obviously at the moment central banks are raising rates pretty rapidly is this going to cause inflation to come down fairly quickly as the central banks hope i mean that's the question of the day really is how effective central banks are going to be in bringing down inflation the pace of the monetary tightening is pretty steep it's the steepest in america since the early s um so after a period of hesitation it looks like they're taking the problem seriously um the real question now is how much pain that's going to cause i think there's a sort of dirty little secret of monetary economics and that's that the actual mechanisms by which higher interest rates flow through the economy aren't that well understood it wouldn't surprise me if they still have to go significantly higher but i have complete faith in the ability of higher interest rates to bring down inflation ultimately because if you raise rates high enough it will it will as ratchet said cause a cause a recession eventually and that's very effective at bringing inflation down if you're a policy maker now like what else are you or should you be thinking about doing to get inflation expectations down to the extent that inflation is about the balance between demand and supply in the economy you know other policies that reduce aggregate demand would bring inflation down as well and their you know tighter fiscal policy raising taxes reducing spending would bring down prices as well what we're being reminded of right now is just how unpopular inflation is how much people dislike um you know prices pump going up um the feeling that when they go to supermarkets they can afford less and less you know and and that has political consequences and can drive politicians and governments to try to do things to rein in price rises the proof is in the pudding central banks have to deliver the low inflation and then people will believe that inflation is going to be low thanks

months to september to the price of a kilogram of tomatoes went up by about tomatoes are really energy intensive products to grow they're grown in greenhouses we all know what our energy bills at home prices are going up wages have gone up there are labor shortages in the uk and growers need to be more competitive in terms of what they're paying their staff and then finally the transportation of

survive whose responsibility is it to try and shield us from these rising costs enter one of our main players the bank of england the bank of england is our central bank here in the uk it has an

time higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more lucrative the theory goes that this will encourage people to spend less lowering demand for goods and services eventually pulling down inflation you essentially reduce the supply of credit to the whole economy in one fell swoop when people save as they're incentivised to do through higher interest rates the less money they have in their pockets to spend in shops on goods and services across the economy that decreases the rate at which prices rise and that's what the bank of england's intention is through increasing interest rates at the moment affects businesses ability to borrow to grow their businesses and invest in the economy if it affects homeowners ability to keep the roof over their head and also it diminishes their ability to spend money on other areas of the economy and invest in their own local economies by buying goods and services locally because their household budgets have been squeezed

1,6,1_rate_bank_central_inflat,"['rate', 'bank', 'central', 'inflat', 'bond', 'economi', 'yield', 'rais', 'reserv', 'mean']","[""presenter few things in the economy are more closely watched than bond yields there are forces in play that merit watching some commodity prices and year treasury yields have climbed presenter that's the president of the federal reserve of atlanta last march speaking about how the fed gauges inflation and why it's keeping a close eye on certain bond yields us government bond yields are a barometer for the economy but they're also more than that us government bond yields are extremely important to the us and even in the global economy bond yields affect everything from the cost of a mortgage to the cost of borrowing for businesses if you're borrowing money that's gonna be determined to a large extent by us government bond yields presenter and changes in yields can impact you here's how bond yields work and why they're so crucial to the economy bright music when we talk about a bond yield we're typically talking about the annualized return an investor earns by holding a bond until its maturity date let's break this down a bond is a contract with features that are set from the start there's the maturity date which refers to the length of the bond's life this is generally two to years bonds that mature between two and years are also called notes then there's it's face value which is the amount the bond is worth when it's first created and the amount it is guaranteed to pay on the maturity date there's also the annual interest rate otherwise known as the coupon rate this is the fixed amount a bond pays each year up to its maturity date so say an investor buys a new year treasury note with a face value of and a coupon or yield of every year the investor will receive and on the th year she'll get back the original she paid for the bond but here's the thing as soon as she buys that bond she can sell it to other investors and when she does certain features of the bond are subject to change if the economy is doing well interest rates may go up which means new bonds will be issued at a higher yield bringing down the value of existing bonds say a new batch of year treasuries pay a yield of suddenly this bond is less attractive to investors and the price has dropped when the price goes down the yield goes up and when interest rates go down this same dynamic happens in reverse the inverse relationship between the price of a bond and it's yield is key to understanding why investors care so much about bond yields and why you sometimes see yields and stocks both going up at the same time investors generally like bonds because they are a safe investment the problem is that that return is gonna be often lower much lower than stocks presenter sam goldfarb covers changes in bond yields and how they're connected to financial markets and the economy if investors are confident about the economy they might not be satisfied with the small return they can get from us government bonds they might choose to buy stocks instead presenter but climbing treasury yields also signal that borrowing is getting more expensive it's basically a proxy for longer term interest rates if you want to get a rough sense of you know where your mortgage rates are gonna be going you might look at the year treasury note and it's yield presenter bond yields aren't just watched by economists and investors the federal reserve keeps a close eye on them as well and they're not just watching bond yields are a key part of monetary policy that the fed uses to help influence the economy there has been an underlying sense of an improved economic outlook and that has to be part of why rates would move back up from the extraordinarily low levels they were at presenter that's the chairman of the federal reserve in march talking about the rise in bond yields during the economic crisis in the fed had slashed short term interest rates at controls to zero in an effort to bolster the economy and encourage spending and bond yields which are heavily influenced by the outlook of short term interest rates also fell to record lows two years later much of the economy has rebounded the economy has rapidly gained strength despite the ongoing pandemic giving rise to persistent supply and demand imbalances and bottlenecks and to elevated inflation presenter last december inflation rose from a year earlier the fastest pace since this reflected rapidly rising prices on everything from houses to groceries and when the fed wants to restrain an overheated economy it raises short term interest rates and when interest rates rise bond yields go up as well if inflation is uncomfortably high people don't like that the fed has a goal of keeping prices stable and so it'll try to cool the economy by raising borrowing costs presenter higher interest rates can send up the price of mortgages and other loans which will likely slow down consumer spending this sounds like a bad thing but only to a point higher bond yields can help cool down the economy which should bring down inflation in the longterm"", ""narrator with inflation hovering around its highest rate in years the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates several times in this is fed chairman jerome powell on what will be needed to ensure a long economic expansion that's gonna require the fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our goal narrator the way the central bank does this is by changing the federal funds rate its main tool for managing the economy you can see on this chart that the rate was lowered to nearly in to boost the economy at the beginning of the pandemic there is an important job for us to move away from these very highly simulative monetary policy settings narrator adjustments to the federal funds rate influence a range of borrowing costs from how much you own your credit card to mortgage rates they also shape broader decisions made by companies like how many people to hire or whether to raise prices here's how the federal funds rate works and how just one rate can guide the entire economy the fed meets every six or so weeks and they're looking at a range of economic data at those meetings but they have two main goals one is to ensure stable prices and low inflation and the other is to make sure that the layer market is strong narrator nick timiraos covers how the fed guides the economy through crises he says you can think of the economy as a car and the fed as the driver they wanna make sure that the economy's not growing too slow and when it is they'll push on the gas but they also wanna make sure that it's not going too fast and so they'll slow the economy down by pressing on the break narrator this is where the federal funds rate comes in when you hear on the news about the fed raising interest rates or cutting interest rates what they're actually deciding to do is to raise or to lower the federal funds rate narrator this is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow money overnight but there's a catch the federal funds rate isn't directly set by the federal reserve so in order to influence it the fed uses a couple of other tools to set a target range these tools are rates that the fed controls in its role as a bank for banks here's the target range that was in place during the federal reserve sets an upper limit and a lower limit with the goal of keeping the effective federal funds rate somewhere in between the upper limit is determined by interest on reserve balances this is the rate of interest a bank gets on deposits known as reserves that it keeps at the federal reserve the lower limit is determined by overnight reverse repurchases these are securities like treasury bills but the federal reserve lends to banks usually for a day while paying interest on this chart you can see where the fed has set the target range between the two yellow lines the blue line which is the effective federal funds rate set by banks sits between the upper and lower limits as the target range changes the effective rate goes up or down with it so far they've had very successful control over guiding the federal funds rate and guiding all short term money market rates to where they generally are trying to move them narrator the fed makes these adjustments in fairly small increments its rate increases for are expected to only change by about a quarter to half of a point at a time so how can these tiny adjustments for banks help cool down the entire economy it all has to do with how those rates ripple through the system as banks are charged more to borrow they'll in turn charge their customers more affecting the cost of existing loans and demand for new borrowing the goal of raising these rates is to drive down demand inflation results when supply and demand are outta whack the fed can't do anything to increase the supply of oil or to increase the number of houses for sale the supply side is something out of their reach but they can bring supply and demand by reducing demand narrator here's how rates can influence demand and inflation when rates are low more people in businesses are likely to take out loans higher demand for goods and services as well as lower rates allows employers to open more positions to meet demand and raise wages to appeal to potential employees consumers then turn around and spend those wages on goods and services which in turn can lead to more jobs and higher prices the opposite happens when rates are higher fewer people and businesses take out loans job growth slows and spending decreases higher interest rates may also make it more appealing to save inflation slows as supply and demand balance out while interest rates can be effective in bringing inflation down a rate hike could take some time to make an impact think about your own life as you go through making different decisions about whether to buy a house and how big of a house to buy it may take a while for this to ripple through the housing market for example but in or months we could begin to see you know less demand if interest rates are high enough to slow interested consumers narrator but while inflation may take time to come down consumers and businesses will likely feel the impact of higher interest rates on loans mortgages and credit cards right away"", ""when central banks raise interest rates it s big news the bank is judging that the only way they can try to pull down inflation is to carry on raising interest rates we re going to see rising rates rising interest rates that will make the cost of borrowing go up it can send ripples across the whole economy it can sink consumer confidence result in fewer jobs and lower wages and cause stock prices to fall if they go too far too fast it can tip economies into recession so why do central banks raise interest rates let s start with the basics if you borrow money you ll have to pay back a little extra to make it worthwhile for the lender well i think we can make you this loan you have a good reputation we know you re reliable i m glad you think so this is the interest rate so if you are taking out a loan you want the interest rate to be as low as possible so you don t have to pay that much back on the flip side if you want to save money then a high interest rate means you can earn more on your savings see it as a reward for leaving money in your account but the size of your reward depends on the circumstances there s no single interest rate in the economy you ve got thousands of banks setting their own commercial rates that s all influenced though by the interest rate that the central bank sets a central bank is like a bank for banks just like you and your savings account banks also earn interest when they leave money with the central bank commercial banks have these things called reserves so that s a bit like their cash on hand commercial banks lend those excess reserves to each other at an interest rate and they also can deposit their excess reserves at the central bank and when they do that they can earn an interest rate ordinary people can t access the interest rate on the excess reserves but it still affects them and that s the idea when central banks raise interest rates they re trying to control inflation how fast prices rise for everyone they were now they re and that s in the space of four weeks central banks like the fed or the bank of england or the european central bank are all trying to hit an inflation target of interest rates are a really powerful tool that they have to do that if inflation is seen as too high that s when banks raise interest rates the change spreads through the financial system and slows down the rate of inflation here s how a rise in interest rates from a central bank means that a commercial bank will earn more on their reserves they might make more from keeping their money in a central bank than lending it out so if they do lend it out they ll raise their interest rates to make it worth their while how that affects consumers depends on the economy take mortgages in places like finland or australia lots of people have mortgages with variable interest rates if you ve got a variable rate mortgage where the interest rate that you pay is linked to the central bank s interest rate then higher interest rates mean that essentially immediately the higher rate will translate into less cash to spend on other things less spare cash means households will spend less and less spending means businesses will be warier of raising prices this should lower inflation in other countries like america or canada a bigger share of mortgages are set at fixed rates people with fixed rates are protected against the direct effects of an interest rate rise but will still feel an indirect impact higher interest rates mean that mortgages will become more expensive if that is affecting all new buyers then house prices will begin to fall and that will make everyone who owns a home feel poorer and therefore they might spend less lower spending will translate into lower inflation and it s not just consumers who will tighten the purse strings when interest rates rise then businesses will find it more expensive to borrow and invest that generally means less economic activity it might mean fewer jobs are created fewer jobs and lower wages could mean less money for households and consumer confidence might suffer which also means less spending people are grappling with a decline in real wages meaning their money buys less when interest rates rise that will tend to slow down spending investment and generally depress economic activity overall that will make businesses more reluctant to raise their prices and that will tend to pull back inflation it sounds straightforward right but the trick is judging how far to go in the federal reserve america s central bank allowed interest rates to rise to a whopping the move curbed inflation but it led to widespread economic pain i regret to say that we re in the worst economic mess since the great depression it is very difficult to get inflation under control without severely denting economic activity in america it s been over years since they ve managed to get inflation down from over without causing a recession a little inflation is ok it keeps the economy moving at a sensible speed but inflation staying high for too long is a problem higher prices means employees will need higher wages pushing up costs for businesses that could drive up prices further potentially leading to an upward spiral of wages and prices retail inflation in india has surged to the combination of tepid economic activity and high inflation poses serious challenges for the indian economy going forward central bankers are really concerned about setting expectations of inflation the idea is that if it can show that it is credible that it will always act to get inflation back down to then maybe it won t have to raise interest rates and then lower them in this kind of seesaw fashion raising interest rates can slow an economy right down the trouble is the brake pedal has a delay it can take as long as two years to see the full results from interest rate changes central banks know this so when they set interest rates they re actually trying to read the road ahead but predicting the future isn t easy the problem is it s difficult for the central bank to work out whether the inflation will fall back on its own and even when central banks do get it right they might still cause a crash it may be a blunt instrument but raising interest rates is still central banks main tool for taming inflation central bankers would say that yes raising interest rates can be painful slowing down the economy is not fun but it s worth it it s worth it to get low and steady inflation so that in the long run you don t have to think about it thank you for watching to read more of our coverage on interest rates click the link and don t forget to subscribe when central banks raise interest rates it's big news bank is judging that the only way they can try to pull down inflation is to carry on raising interest rates we're going to see rising rates rising interest rates that will make the cost to borrowing go up it can send ripples across the whole economy it can sink consumer confidence result in fewer jobs and lower wages and cause stock prices to fall if they go too far too fast it can tip economies into recession so why do central banks raise interest rates music let's start with the basics if you borrow money you'll have to pay back a little extra to make it worthwhile for the lender well i think we can make you this long you have a good reputation we know you're reliable i'm glad you think so this is the interest rate so if you are taking out a loan you want the interest rate to be as low as possible so you don't have to pay that much back on the flip side if you want to save money then a high interest rate means you can earn more on your savings see it as a reward for leaving money in your account but the size of your reward depends on the circumstances there's no single interest rate in the economy you've got thousands of banks setting their own commercial rates that's all influenced though by the interest rate that the central bank sets a central bank is like a bank for banks just like you and your savings account banks also earn interest when they leave money with a central bank commercial banks have these things called reserves so that's a bit like their cash on hand commercial banks lend those excess reserves to each other at an interest rate and they also can deposit their excess reserves at the central bank and when they do that they can earn an interest rate ordinary people can't access the interest rate on the excess reserves but it still affects them and that's the idea when central banks raise interest rates they're trying to control inflation how fast prices rise for everyone they were now they won and last in the space of four weeks central banks like the fed or the bank of england or the european central bank are all trying to hit an inflation target of two percent interest rates are a really powerful tool that they have to do that if inflation is seen as too high that's when banks raise interest rates the change spreads through the financial system and slows down the rate of inflation here's how a rise in interest rates from a central bank means that a commercial bank will earn more on their reserves they might make more from keeping their money in a central bank then lending it out so if they do lend it out they'll raise their interest rates to make it worth their while how that affects consumers depends on the economy take mortgages in places like finland or australia lots of people have mortgages with variable interest rates if you've got a variable rate mortgage where the interest rate that you pay is linked to the central bank's interest rate then higher interest rates mean that essentially immediately the higher rate will translate into less cash to spend on other things less spare cash means households will spend less and less spending means businesses will be warier of raising prices this should lower inflation in other countries like america or canada a bigger share of mortgages are set at fixed rates people with fixed rates are protected against the direct effects of an interest rate rise but will still feel an indirect impact higher interest rates mean that mortgages will become more expensive if that is affecting all new buyers then house prices will begin to fall and that will make everyone who owns a home feel poorer and therefore they might spend less lower spending will translate into lower inflation and it's not just consumers who will tighten the purse strings when interest rates rise then businesses will find it more expensive to borrow and invest that generally means less economic activity it might mean fewer jobs are created fewer jobs and lower wages could mean less money for households and consumer confidence might suffer which also means less spending people are grappling with a decline in real wages meaning their money buys less when interest rates rise that will tend to slow down spending investment and generally depress economic activity overall that will make businesses more reluctant to raise their prices and that will tend to pull back inflation it sounds straightforward right but the trick is judging how far to go in the federal reserve america's central bank allowed interest rates to rise to a whopping the move curbed inflation but it led to widespread economic pain i regret to say that we're in the worst economic mess since the great depression it is very difficult to get inflation under control without severely denting economic activity in america it's been over years since they've managed to get inflation down from over five percent without causing a recession a little inflation is okay it keeps the economy moving at a sensible speed but inflation staying high for too long is a problem higher prices means employees will need higher wages pushing up costs for businesses that could drive up prices further potentially leading to an upward spiral of wages and prices retail inflation india has surged to percent the combination of step economic activity and high inflation poses serious challenges for indian economy going forward central bankers are really concerned about setting expectations of inflation the idea is that if it can show that it is credible that it will always act to get inflation back down to two percent then maybe it won't have to you know raise interest rates and then lower them in this kind of seesaw fashion raising interest rates can slow an economy right down the trouble is the brake pedal has a delay it can take as long as two years to see the full results from interest rate changes central banks know this so when they set interest

2,5,2_act_tax_invest_reduct,"['act', 'tax', 'invest', 'reduct', 'energi', 'state', 'year', 'make', 'american', ""we'r""]","[""so vicki today marks one year since president biden signed the inflation reduction act the controversial legislation has been praised by democrats for its investment in climate issues and criticized by republicans for raising taxes but surveys suggests most americans don't really know what all is in it lucky for us our noah pransky is here to explain it hey noah hey there so what isn't it the things in it you got climate investments health care reforms corporate tax reforms on their own all of these are individually popular and as the legislation turns one today the president wants you to know who is responsible we've heard lots of debate about the inflation reduction act the most important investment that we've ever made in our energy security the biggest tax hike the history of our country but do you really know what's in it let's break it down the inflation reduction act also known as the ira committed a half trillion dollars over the next years toward clean energy and health care investments we're talking about tax credits for electric vehicles for improving your home energy consumption and for companies that produce renewable energy also insulin price caps prescription drug reform and affordable care act subsidies to pay for it the ira also included increased irs enforcement and a corporate minimum tax the congressional budget office found the bill would more than pay for itself and in the year since it was signed inflation has pretty much done what the president promised it would this bill will in fact reduce inflationary pressure on the economy we're back close once again to the fed's two percent inflation target but economists have been skeptical about attributing any drop in our inflation rate to the inflation reduction act in fact not even president biden appears to be making that claim anymore at a recent fundraiser he said quote i wish i hadn't called it the inflation reduction act because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing alternatives that generate economic growth wind energy is cheaper than fossil fuels salt orange is cheaper regardless only one in four americans say today that they have a good idea of what's in the bill and yale researchers found that only of america approves of it however when that same group of respondents was briefed on the contents of the bill their support nearly doubled to the provisions are popular in the rare cases where americans are actually familiar with them which may explain the president's recent interest in barnstorming the country folks every republican voted against our clean energy investment known as inflation reduction eager to talk all things ira i mean let's talk about branding honestly at the end of the day the name of it didn't work biden doesn't even like the name of it now but and you've mentioned that really interesting survey that found what of people approved of what was actually in once they learned what's in it right well what about lawmakers this is crazy to me the reaction across party lines did people not know what they were voting for uh well i think lawmakers had an idea but again branding right so it's part of the republican brand to oppose anything that the biden administration does it's part of their democratic brand but nobody's really selling what's in it and just to prove your point uh this yale study which showed huge shifts in favorability they mentioned the word investment and not spending that's where we saw the popularity almost double so again depending what you call it spending investment makes a big difference absolutely words matter words matter energy interesting as always thank you for breaking that down thanks for watching our youtube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the nbc news app"", ""the bill i'm about to sign is not just about today it's about tomorrow it's about delivering progress and prosperity to american families the inflation reduction act was the largest investment in clean energy in the history of the world the inflation reduction act is going to rapidly accelerate our pathway to net zero a sweeping piece of legislation that is designed to decarbonise the us economy to reshore supply chains and also to break dependence on china it levels the playing field for western producers it's the largest investment in the history of the united states' solar industry of any kind the so called paris climate accord it's a disaster a death sentence it's possible that you could see in a re election of donald trump and at that point i think all bets would be off the big question is whether this ends up being a trade war we thought we were in the era of free market globalisation and now we're not the inflation reduction act is actually a very misleading name because it has very little to do with inflation reduction particularly in the short term it's a piece of industrial policy it's a piece of climate policy it's a piece of trade policy it's not a piece of inflation reduction it's full of tax credits designed to draw in investment into the us economy and it's all being funded by the federal government over the next years the ira includes bn worth of tax credits loans and grants to incentivise domestic manufacturing the biden administration says you know what it is important that america makes things it is important not only that we transition to a greener economy but it's important to be able to secure supply chains this is a big shift this is about a year change in how the economy is going to run is this actually going to create long term viable industries which are more competitive than the chinese we have to face the risk that it won't work and when the subsidies stop unless they're there forever the programme won't really have worked and some of these may turn out to be white elephants i'm john podesta i am overseeing the implementation of the clean energy provisions of the inflation reduction act the largest investment in clean energy and attacking the problem of climate change in the history of the world the impact on emissions of the ira are expected to be about per cent cut by if all the tax credits are taken up at the heart of it was an economic theory invest in american technology and manufacturing power the economy reduce the dependency the united states had on unreliable single source suppliers of certain goods and materials the chips and science act passed first it's a much smaller industrial policy it includes around bn to incentivise research in semiconductors as well as stimulate semiconductor production in the united states it's really in a way a partner bit of legislation it's also about reshoring supply chains according to ft research the ira and the chips act together have helped stimulate more than bn in manufacturing and clean technologies and semiconductors this will create more than a hundred thousand jobs it's clearly designed to tell the world that america is back as a major player in world industry and in the climate fight sleepy old america is gone we've already seen over bn of investment in clean manufacturing over bn in utility scale renewable energy so you have arizona that's sucking in money from the inflation reduction and the chips act the midwest states like ohio michigan upstate new york is taking advantage of this in the southeast georgia the states that may have been once resistant to clean energy and so on for political reasons i think what you're seeing in georgia is a bipartisan embrace of the opportunities and investments in advanced energy manufacturing and electric vehicle manufacturing that are being supercharged by these manufacturing and infrastructure policies we made the initial investment in the united states in and we're making a much larger expansion after passage of the inflation reduction act it's about a bn investment by the end of next year we're going to collectively employ about people directly across the state it's the largest investment in the history of the united states solar industry of any kind we've worked really closely with folks in georgia and washington dc over the last five years the solar manufacturing policies alongside this broad package of manufacturing incentives are designed to make georgia the national and global leader in advanced energy innovation and manufacturing solar technology and solar products are strategic commodities poly silicon ingots wafers cells but a significant stranglehold historically on the market in china our energy security our energy independence and our environmental future depend upon our production of these technologies to components in the united states solar panels that we make here at this factory are used for both commercial and residential now you're going to see where the magic happens i started my career in manufacturing because i knew i wanted to follow in my parents footsteps went into textiles ladies undergarments georgia was not known for advanced manufacturing our facility here has transformed the job market we're keeping students when they're coming out of school and they're coming to work they're buying homes here we want to see the entire supply chain for our product here in georgia products that come out of this facility will contain cells wafers and poly silicon that all originated in the united states a state like georgia has lots of land its labour is relatively cheap its governor has been very progressive in terms of offering subsidies on top of the ones that come with the federal inflation reduction act and developers are arriving in what people are now calling the battery belt in the south you have norway's freyr announcing a bn factory in georgia creating more than jobs the production tax credits in the ira levels the playing field for western producers the hope is that through the years of the ira programme scale has been developed supply chains get developed then western producers can compete one on one with the chinese producers from that point forward so our initial project in georgia in the us is called giga america we have a site south of atlanta the amount of investment will be roughly bn to bn could go up to around bn to bn critics especially outside the us have called the inflation reduction act and the chips act a new form of protectionism an extension of what donald trump was doing from this day forward it's going to be only america first the us is undergoing a bipartisan shift bringing into america industries in which china is or potentially will be dominant biden is doing it through subsidies trump did it through tariffs now you see companies like general electric an american company that absolutely embodied the idea that you could build things more cheaply abroad and then sell them back to americans it offshored as much as it could now ge is building a new factory in schenectady new york schenectady new york represents a lot of the legacy of general electric it's where edison founded the company we're investing mn we're adding union jobs to create what will be the largest onshore wind and cell facility in the us i would like to think that you know they would have picked schenectady anyways but probably not i know the ira has been a big part of it so we're in upstate new york we're probably not the lowest labour rate in the world it is very good work for the existing skill set that we have and to bring in all this new blood that can then learn from people who've been building generators and turbines for years general electric is an important employer for the schenectady area and frankly depending on what chapter over the last years one in which we've been reducing jobs not adding jobs i'm actually a third generation ge schenectady employee my grandfather started here in and retired in the ' s my father retired after years service in i worked down the hall with somebody who has five generations most of the people in here have a relative who've worked in general electric if they're from schenectady you know somebody who worked for ge at some point schenectady peaked maybe back in the ' s and ' s with people here there's still plus people on the schenectady campus this is by far the biggest investment that i've been a part of in my years here factories like to know that there's work in front of them and that they're going to be here for a long time to be sustainable and to have the business have enough confidence that schenectady can do this that we're the right place to put it is just huge developers are listening they understand that because of these tax credits they can actually thrive in the us they can make the profits there it will have an impact on global trade it does look protectionist it is clearly designed to shift production from foreign places to america and that's ultimately what a lot of protection is designed to do some of the architects of globalisation for example john podesta who is now president biden's official in charge of the inflation reduction act he was part of the clinton administration opening global markets and then was part of the obama administration that did the same years of american economic policy heading in one direction now american policy is about re industrialising its heartlands even if that means shutting off cheap supplies from elsewhere it is a fundamentally different approach we're in conversation with our allies and friends and trading partners executed a critical minerals agreement with japan we have a free trade agreement with canada and mexico we have a free trade agreement with korea which permits them to take advantage of some of the provisions of the ira we're in deep conversation about doing a critical minerals agreement with europe what the inflation reduction act has demonstrated to countries around the world that they can be part of the solution too they can make those investments the inflation reduction act has changed the world we are really at an inflection point we're moving from a world that has been globalising a world in which rich countries have been essentially offshoring and outsourcing production to emerging markets and developing countries the ira programme is set up to drive green nationalism ronald reagan's attitude to economic policy and his famous remark the nine most dangerous words in the english language are i'm from the government and i'm here to help that's just dead and bipartisan dead the biden administration thought that it was rejoining the climate fight everybody would welcome leadership from the us in fact the reaction especially in europe has been quite hostile it's pretty clearly a violation of the wto you could say by now the wto is moribund anyway who cares but it's another nail in the coffin the basic consensus was that the governments create the rules the framework within which business operates but governments aren't actually in the competitive arena with their money once you move to a world in which they are everything becomes very uncertain and unpredictable and it makes co operation much more difficult and these were all the reasons why after the ' s we tried to create something like the gatt wto so it could be very bad for international relations and the international economy it got a lot of flak from europeans which i found kind of amazing because europe and many countries for example have been complaining for years that america should do more about climate this bill does mark a fundamental shift away from the market knows best strategy we're going to say climate change is a war that we have to win fighting for a clean energy future requires industrial strategy and that's not about the market that's about the state being an actor in the economy and really pushing change that frankly the market hasn't made in the last three or four decades it's clearly going to encourage european businesses to invest in america indeed it's already happening it is making the us look more attractive and be more competitive they're doing it with the fiscal firepower of a unified federal government and the europeans obviously find it very difficult to respond to that in aggregate because they don't have a federal fiscal power the concern of course is that the response in europe will generate a subsidy war within europe we've already touched off a subsidy where we have a kind of arms race that's been touched off a green arms race do we need subsidies or economic incentives to develop this industrialisation yes there is a risk of a battle of subsidies even internally in eu by the way because of course the level of development of countries are different this race to the bottom in internal subsidies could be fundamentally distorting and even i think threaten the single market everybody knows who will win that subsidy war germany will win it because their fiscal position is so much stronger and they have a bigger domestic market what the ira has allowed is the us to take a leadership position in the transition i think it is something that they're striving for i don't think it necessarily puts the us in a leadership position until you see the scale get built out what that does for europe i think is challenges some of the jurisdictions in europe it has been a wake up call for europe on the industrialisation policy which was not something that you do at european level it's not an industrialisation force as it is not a foreign policy force because of the nature of the institution is not the federation where is the space of competitiveness for europe and in some cases chinese won already in the battery industry or the electric vehicle industry we may have space but we have to define this can we do that together with the us or independently i think that's a big question mark what i hear from a lot of european companies and i hear from european governments as well is look the united states is pushing us we need to get our act together we want to see rapid deployment of clean technologies in europe that's in the world's interest and that's why we're in dialogue on things like trying to land a critical minerals agreement there's every chance that at some point the eu and the us are agree on some shared way to source minerals for the energy transition but for now the tensions are at the fore and they could get much worse it will create trade tension it is already creating trade tension we know that nobody can develop on its own and we need this balance between openness and national development so it's a very uncharted waters it could be very dangerous we are exactly in the format of the s more protectionism more tension more investment in military that's not bode well you could imagine retaliation on one side leads to counter retaliation globally in the context in which there's already very bad relations between the western powers and china and lead to a very dangerous downward spiral in trade and in international relations what this legislation is intending to do is to ensure that the united states keeps its commitment on climate and it'll have a very substantial benefit to the global economy make no mistake about it the investments in the united states driving down the price will help economies globally deploy at scale and it's going to be a major challenge to get these factories built and running construction groups think the sector needs to fill another new jobs just in the next year alone more labourers than the us actually has available quite how the administration fixes that problem is unknown so what does the biden administration do then does it soften the terms for local labour and so on does it start to turn a blind eye to the import of wafers from china for solar panels for example i think this obsession we have to reduce dependence on china again can be understood but cannot be an objective in itself sometime nationalism is blurring the rational thinking china remains the factory of the world for all these parts that will be critical in batteries and solar china controls almost all of the anodes the cathodes for batteries it controls almost all of the lithium processing it builds almost all the wafers that are used in solar panels china will remain a dominant supplier to the us and everywhere else in many essential areas it's really impossible to cut it out and at some point i think the biden administration will have to come to an answer about whether they prioritise the cutting of emissions and doing all this cheaply which probably means more supplies from countries like china or whether it really is about re industrialisation and the climate targets can be delayed we can't keep the objective of global warming temperature as a limit if we don't do technological co operation we need chinese capacity if we operate in a very fluid economic environment without this trade tension we will achieve the climate goal more quickly to create a transformation in the industrial system you have to distort markets one of the big challenges is that once you start doing that you create political allies that want that distortion to continue american producers of solar panels are more expensive than their overseas competitors that along with a bunch of supply chain issues means that us buyers of solar power are paying more money than their competitors overseas that's over the long term not good for the green transition because it makes a very promising technology more expensive i think the europeans relied on cheap fossil fuels or at least lower priced fossil fuels from russia they regretted that at the end of the day after russia violated international law and invaded ukraine this idea that cheapest is always best opens you up to economic security problems in the next to years we need to fully decarbonise that's going to require a guide and a market guide from government and private investments to work that's what we see happening right now with the inflation reduction act china is now the largest emitter in the world almost double the size of the united states the united states remains the world's historic largest emitter we both have to do more competition can be healthy in this sector too it can drive down costs it can lead to innovation i think it's also important to realise that it was passed in the follow up of the pandemic in which supply chains around the world were completely strained our supply chains here in the united states are going to be as low carbon as it gets because we're getting our poly silicon from a facility in washington state which has a high degree of hydropower that's powering its grid meaning that the embedded carbon in the products that we produce here will also be lowered there are big questions about how the ira will impact the global south the understandable complaint from emerging markets is hey western world you had your fun you had years of polluting and now you want to change everything and we have to pay the price even though we don't get the same level of development and that's a very legitimate criticism there are countries like chile which was a leader in green hydrogen or was poised to become a leader in green hydrogen chile can't afford the subsidies that the us has so its natural advantage of abundant renewable energy has been wiped out us like europe and others have to buy a lot of critical materials that for the moment are mostly controlled by china it's not possible just to consider only the national interest and not the necessity for developing countries to in a way develop their own industry and not a new model we have to invent if not we will have a lot of tension and a lot of blockage and a lot of competition from china or others and i don't think we necessarily will win this competition you could imagine the us and europe bringing countries in africa and latin america into a new trade paradigm where they say hey we will help fund some of the clean transition in exchange for guarantees of critical minerals that's what the ira does it says fundamentally we are going to need some politics some statecraft as part of the climate transition and we're not going to be able to just come up with a carbon price and expect the global south to pay for it the climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state it's an existential threat one of the other really fascinating features of the investment that we are seeing since the passage of the inflation reduction act and the chips act is that per cent of the money is going to republican districts it is very ironic when republicans didn't support the ira and few republicans supported the chips act maybe not so good news for the democrats if they can't take the credit for creating those jobs the so called paris climate accord it's a disaster a death sentence it's possible that you could see in a re election of donald trump and at that point i think all bets would be off one of the really important features of the inflation reduction act according to developers and their lawyers when they look at the fine print is that the tax credits are embedded in the legislation for years quite how a future republican government could unpick them is yet to be seen will all of it stay probably not will there be a big effort by the by a second trump administration to roll back a lot of regulation put judges in place that don't want the administrative state to have so much power absolutely so there's going to be a lot of chaos but the president is the president and if you saw someone like trump come in and simply just use all the tools of the executive office to make it very difficult to get things done then yeah i think that that would be a real headwind when the affordable care act originally passed it was unpopular as people understood that obamacare was really delivering it became popular and i think that will happen with regard to these investments when the jobs are created when steel is in the ground the inflation reduction act has put a line in the sand with a post neoliberal politics in which the market doesn't always know best there comes a time when the government has a role to play in ensuring public goods like dealing with global warming there are big challenges i won't kid you we've got permitting challenges we've got supply chain challenges interest rate challenges we're investing in this country we're building things again that will deal with the environmental consequences of generations of over reliance on fossil fuels it won't go close to actually achieving net zero globally much of the other things that are needed are going to be far more politically difficult than this there is nobody operating in the clean energy sector or in the semiconductor sector who thinks that the us can do it alone nobody america does not have all of the means to control all of the supply chains for the clean energy revolution period it will be seen as revolutionary in the general view we have of what the western world thinks the right way of doing economic policy is the americans real advocates of free markets and free trade have said we are going to do it in a different way i don't think that can happen in the us without changing everything america has been the exemplar and the shaper of the world order ever since the second world war we thought we were in the era of free market globalisation and now we're not"", ""inflation is the highest it's been in four decades which has cause for alarm and reason for lawmakers to address it head on and in the two days since senate democrats passed the inflation reduction act and sent it to the house for its deliberation we've heard all the snippets and sound bites on how the bill is not really what they say it is of course nearly all of that talk is coming from those who voted against it like idaho senators mike crapo and jim risch they say despite its name the page bill is not about reducing inflation but just increasing taxes and scrutiny over who is paying them president biden promised those increased taxes would not be imposed on those making less than thousand a year critics say the president is wrong and the act will actually raise taxes on everyone senator risch claiming such in his explanation on why he voted against it on sunday these tax hikes won't affect just the highest tax bracket americans making as little as thousand dollars per year will pay more to federal government because of this bill and senator crapo saying nearly the same thing a week ago and during the year period the average tax burden increases would increase for nearly every income category crapo by the way quoting the joint committee on taxation who put out the review of the bill a committee on which grepo happens to sit well those two statements solicited these questions from you laura asking us to explain senator crapo's comment that anyone making thirty thousand or more on taxes on or will have their taxes increased under the bill where is he seeing this increase rick wanting us to tell him how the act will impact families that have thirty thousand dollar income as rishi stated and kim what can you please fact check rish's comment about nude act about the new act increasing taxes for folks as low as well we reached out to both senators crapo and risch and neither responded to our questions or requests for an interview but chief political reporter joe perez was able to speak with a boise accountant to in fact fact checked fact check those claims about taxes going up for those making less than thousand a year national conversation continues to center on the inflation reduction act and depending on what side of the aisle you're on you may hear two very different conversations a major question though about the act does it keep the promise of president joe biden who said the act would not raise taxes on people making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year critics say no supporters say yes so we went nonpartisan for an analysis on the act boise cpa jeff beebe says he expects calls soon from clients i will this week once it really starts getting into the press i'll have people start to call me a major question he will likely get how will this act impact taxes we asked bibi to explain some of the language inside of it we cash rates aren't changing as part of the the uh act but there are some things that for corporations are raising taxes which they'll end up passing through to consumers so while you may not be paying taxes directly you'll be paying more for it while the individual tax rates for those making less than four hundred thousand dollars doesn't change the act does include a new percent minimum tax on corporations that earn more than a billion dollars in annual profits the tax works to focus on some u s companies that avoid paying the standard corporate tax rate including some companies that end up paying no taxes at all due to clever maneuvering experts say don't expect the major corporations to bite the bullet on paying new taxes you take amazon as an example very early on amazon didn't make any money for years so they had a big net operating loss carryover that they've been using up now that they're profitable but it still is an offset that was legal to use but very unpopular politically so it's focused on companies like that or that they're reinvesting large amounts of their income into other things that are deductions they don't want all these deductions getting away they're not going to just take a hit to the bottom line they're going to pass it through to consumers so what could that look like usually it would be a a price increase it might be lowering the rate of wage increases although with our current environment of tight employment you can't mess with people's wages too much it's going to be in price increase so while tax rates might not change low and medium earning americans could see a cost associated with the new act but tax credits built into the act for things like green energy and electric cars or medicare benefits well those also are supposed to offset those costs bibi says he's also watching another part of the act an billion dollar investment into the internal revenue service the irs the goal is to crack down on dishonest tax filings that cost the country millions of dollars well they're talking about hiring up to employees which is almost doubling the size of the irs and which will make a big impact on irs audits the irs has kind of a tough job they enforce a very unpopular law everybody understands that the government needs money to operate they just don't want it to be my money i want to be somebody else's money so the irs has more resources i guess the logic here would be okay less less under reporting right yeah they'll go after that under reporting and that's under reporting from individuals is billion it's much larger for from individuals than corporations or payroll taxes and who's that going to go to that's mostly going to be people that make under four hundred thousand dollars a year again that's on a tax increase because that's tax law that exists it's just people are paying it and the irs is going to try and collect it it'll be focused on people making it under because there are more more of those people than there are over and there's a lot of i guess intricacy to get into this entire thing and of course we don't have time to go through it right now but if you wanted to read more and i recommend you do go to our website right now ktvb com we have an explanation of what's in the act how it works why it works that way as well as we track this whole thing through brian it's important to know this is non god to the pri the president's desk that still technically has to pass another house over in congress when the president does sign it that would start triggering you know differences for cpas across the country they're going to have to look at things but we'll wait and watch for now and again we'd love to sit down with senators crepe and rich to find out get a little bit more explanation as to why they voted no and why they're saying the saying the things they're saying about it all right thanks joe""]"
